Multiple samples may be taken from a beach and samples may be tested by culture, DNA testing, or both.\r\n\r\nWhat do these numbers mean? \r\n\r\nThe modeling prediction numbers forecast real-time Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria levels present in the water. The Chicago Park District (CPD) in partnership with the US Geological Survey, has developed statistical prediction models by using weather data pulled from CPD buoys (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/qmqz-2xku) and weather stations (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/k7hf-8y75). E. coli is an indicator species for the presence of disease-causing bacteria, viruses, and protozoans that may pose health risks to the public.\r\n\r\nThe culture based testing numbers indicate E. coli levels present in the water. This method requires 18-24 hours of processing to receive results. US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) recommends notifying the public when E. coli bacteria levels are above the federal water quality Beach Action Value (BAV), which is 235*CFU. When bacteria levels exceed 235 CFU, a yellow or red flag will be implemented. This standard is used at beaches throughout the Great Lakes region. For more information please refer to the USEPA Recreational Water Quality Criteria.\r\n\r\nThe rapid testing method (qPCR analysis) is a new method that measures levels of pathogenic DNA in beach water. Unlike the culture based test that requires up to 24 hours of processing, the new rapid testing method requires a few hours for results. The Chicago Park District can use results of the rapid test to notify the public when levels exceed UPEPA recommended levels.

As of 2016, this list includes all commercial, institutional, and residential buildings larger than 50,000 square feet. The information in this dataset should be used by building owners / managers or other building representatives to determine if your property needs to comply by the annual deadline of June 1st. This data can also be used to look up your property's unique 6-digit Chicago Energy Benchmarking ID, which is required for compliance. (The ID is also included the notification letters sent by the City.)\r\n\r\nThe Energy Benchmarking Ordinance calls on existing municipal, commercial, and residential buildings larger than 50,000 square feet to track whole-building energy use, report to the City annually, and verify data accuracy every three years. The law, which phases in from 2014-2017, covers less than 1% of Chicago’s buildings, which account for approximately 20% of total energy used by all buildings. For more details, including ordinance text, rules and regulations, and timing, please visit www.CityofChicago.org/EnergyBenchmarking.\r\n\r\nNote that the ordinance authorizes the City to make individual building data readily-available to the public, beginning with the second year in which a building is covered. The Covered Buildings List is distinct from the publicly-shared energy use data, and does not include energy use or any other information reported in the benchmarking process. For the building-specific energy use dataset, see https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/xq83-jr8c.\r\n\r\nIf your property is on this list, and you do not believe you are covered by the ordinance, please submit the appropriate online exemption form at: www.CityofChicago.org/EnergyBenchmarking. If your property is not on the list, and it meets the compliance criteria, please check for any alternative building addresses. If the building is still not found, please submit the Building ID Request Form (http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/mayor/iframe/Benchmarking_ID_Request.html). The Chicago Energy Benchmarking Help Center can assist with any other questions, and can be reached at (855)858-6878, or by email: Info@ChicagoEnergyBenchmarking.org.\r\n\r\nThis dataset will be refreshed periodically as additional information becomes available. It is advisable to use the then-current version of any dataset, if possible.","title":"Chicago Energy Benchmarking - Covered Buildings","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/g5i5-yz37/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/g5i5-yz37/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/g5i5-yz37/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/g5i5-yz37/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["Environment & Sustainable Development"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/nd4p-ckx9","issued":"2017-02-15","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2017-02-15","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":""},"identifier":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/nd4p-ckx9","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cityofchicago.org"},"description":"FOIA requests received by the Department of Fleet & Facility Management since January 1, 2012.","title":"FOIA Request Log - Fleet & Facility Management","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/nd4p-ckx9/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/nd4p-ckx9/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/nd4p-ckx9/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/nd4p-ckx9/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["FOIA"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/6rq2-yx28","issued":"2017-02-11","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2017-02-11","keyword":["array of things"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"","hasEmail":"mailto:dataportal@cityofchicago.org"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cityofchicago.org"},"identifier":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/6rq2-yx28","description":"Locations of Array of Things sensor nodes.

A Depends Upon Requirements contract is an indefinite quantities contract in which the City places orders as needed and the vendor is not guaranteed any particular contract award amount. \r\n\r\nBlanket vs. Standard Contracts: Only blanket contracts (contracts for repeated purchases) have FMPS end dates. Standard contracts (for example, construction contracts) terminate upon completion and acceptance of all deliverables. These dates are tracked outside of FMPS. \r\n\r\nNegative Modifications: Some contracts are modified to delete scope and money from a contract. These reductions are indicated by negative numbers in the Award Amount field of this dataset. \r\n\r\nData Owner: Procurement Services. \r\nTime Period: 1993 to present. \r\nFrequency: Data is updated daily.","title":"Contracts","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/rsxa-ify5/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/rsxa-ify5/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/rsxa-ify5/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/rsxa-ify5/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["Administration & Finance"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/x8fc-8rcq","issued":"2015-09-10","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2015-09-11","keyword":["libraries","facilities","gis"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":""},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cityofchicago.org"},"identifier":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/x8fc-8rcq","description":"Chicago Public Library locations, contact information, and hours of operation.","title":"Libraries - Locations, Hours and Contact Information","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/x8fc-8rcq/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/x8fc-8rcq/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/x8fc-8rcq/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/x8fc-8rcq/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["Education"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/g8p5-y4m5","issued":"2015-09-01","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2017-04-08","keyword":["ethics","lobbyists"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"","hasEmail":"mailto:dataportal@cityofchicago.org"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cityofchicago.org"},"identifier":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/g8p5-y4m5","description":"Clients represented by registered lobbyists as reported in their Lobbyist Statements  of Registration.

(See City Council Meeting schedule: https://chicago.legistar.com/Calendar.aspx.)  The collection of street segments for a single zone (collectively identified by Zone number) are not required to constitute a seamless polygon; however, they must be contiguous; in this sense, “Zones” often closer resemble a collection of intersecting segments rather than an unbroken area. Segments are commonly categorized as being either “Standard” or “Buffer”: Standard means that signs exist on the street segment beginning at the low-point and ending at the high-point; Buffer means that physical signs do not exist for that zone on that physical street, but residents of addresses within that segment shall have the privilege to purchase zone products (daily permits and annual passes) for that zone, as if physical signs were installed.  (In this way, segments designated as ‘Buffer’ can in fact overlap with either other buffers and/or standard segments.)  Physical signs will display the zone number and the day/times when the zone restriction is in effect, e.g., “All Times” / “Anytime”; “Monday through Friday”; “6am – 6pm All Days.”  During restricted days/times, any vehicle parked in the zone which does not display a valid unexpired zone product (either a daily permit or an annual pass printed on the City Vehicle Sticker) is subject to ticketing/enforcement.

For a more detailed description, go to: http://bit.ly/Q9AZAD. \r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago’s arterial streets (nonfreeway\r\nstreets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every ten minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimate by traffic segments gives the observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic.\r\n\r\nTraffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O’Hare airport area).\r\nThis dataset contains the current estimated speed for about 1250 segments covering 300 miles of arterial roads.\r\nThere is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent\r\nintersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates\r\ntogether may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.","title":"Chicago Traffic Tracker - Congestion Estimates by Segments","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/n4j6-wkkf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/n4j6-wkkf/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/n4j6-wkkf/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/n4j6-wkkf/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["Transportation"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/c7ck-438e","issued":"2014-09-15","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2014-10-28","keyword":["crime","police"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":""},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cityofchicago.org"},"identifier":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/c7ck-438e","description":"Illinois Uniform Crime Reporting (IUCR) codes are four digit codes that law enforcement agencies use to classify criminal incidents when taking individual reports.

Non-index offenses are all other types of criminal incidents, including vandalism, weapons violations, public peace violations, etc.","title":"Chicago Police Department - Illinois Uniform Crime Reporting (IUCR) Codes","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/c7ck-438e/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/c7ck-438e/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/c7ck-438e/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/c7ck-438e/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["Public Safety"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/a2fk-ec6q","issued":"2014-09-12","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2014-10-06","keyword":["english","spanish","language","census"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"","hasEmail":"mailto:epidatarequests@cityofchicago.org"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cityofchicago.org"},"identifier":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/a2fk-ec6q","description":"This dataset contains estimates of the number of residents aged 5 years or older in Chicago who “speak English less than very well,” by the non-English language spoken at home and community area of residence, for the years 2008 – 2012.

For a detailed description, go to: http://bitly.com/TeqrNv. \r\n\r\nThe Chicago Traffic Tracker estimates traffic congestion on Chicago’s arterial streets (non-freeway streets) in real-time by continuously monitoring and analyzing GPS traces received from Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) buses. Two types of congestion estimates are produced every 10 minutes: 1) by Traffic Segments and 2) by Traffic Regions or Zones. Congestion estimates by traffic segments gives observed speed typically for one-half mile of a street in one direction of traffic. Traffic Segment level congestion is available for about 300 miles of principal arterials. Congestion by Traffic Region gives the average traffic condition for all arterial street segments within a region. A traffic region is comprised of two or three community areas with comparable traffic patterns. 29 regions are created to cover the entire city (except O’Hare airport area). \r\n\r\nThere is much volatility in traffic segment speed. However, the congestion estimates for the traffic regions remain consistent for a relatively longer period. Most volatility in arterial speed comes from the very nature of the arterials themselves. Due to a myriad of factors, including but not limited to frequent intersections, traffic signals, transit movements, availability of alternative routes, crashes, short length of the segments, etc. Speed on individual arterial segments can fluctuate from heavily congested to no congestion and back in a few minutes. The segment speed and traffic region congestion estimates together may give a better understanding of the actual traffic conditions.","title":"Chicago Traffic Tracker - Congestion Estimates by Regions","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/t2qc-9pjd/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/t2qc-9pjd/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/t2qc-9pjd/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/t2qc-9pjd/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"theme":["Transportation"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/ezma-pppn","issued":"2014-09-08","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2017-04-08","keyword":["business","licenses"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":""},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cityofchicago.org"},"identifier":"https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/ezma-pppn","description":"This dataset contains the owner information for all the accounts listed in the Business License Dataset, and is sorted by Account Number.

This prohibition does not apply to restaurants, hotels offering restaurant services, or not-for-profit clubs.

These categories were established to help the City identify and regulate the various types of establishments serving alcoholic beverages.

The Chicago City Council has passed a series of ordinances restricting the issuance of liquor licenses in various locations throughout the City in sections 4-60-022 and 4-60-023 of the Municipal Code. In general, consumption on premises liquor licenses are affected by the 022 moratorium and Package Goods are affected by the 023 moratorium. However, moratoriums can be complicated, so determining whether or not a moratorium applies to a specific license application is not always straightforward. Users of the data should contact the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection if they have any questions. These GIS layers show the locations of moratoriums passed by the City Council.
