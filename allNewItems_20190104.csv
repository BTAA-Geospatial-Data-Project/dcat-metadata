The attribute fields are based on ones provided in Ramsey County Users Group shapefiles, ParPts and OnLineCore, and MetroGIS Parcel Datasets. These fields are populated from a compilation of records and information from various state, county and city offices, and other sources. This data is joined to Ramsey Countys Parcel data using a property identification number (PIN) which is assigned to both polygons and points and is the primary link to county tax and assessment data.?In 1986, parcels were digitized from hand drawn 1:2400 half and 1:1200 quarter section maps. In 1995, the parcel data layer was converted to ArcINFO format and held in the ArcStorm data base. Parcels were converted in 2005 to an ESRI ArcGIS GeoDatabase. In 2013, Attributes, which were previously joined only to Parcel Points, were added to Parcel Polygons.?Parcel Points are used to represent the one-to-many relationship that Common Interest Communities (CIC), Apartment Ownerships or Condominiums, as well as Manufactured Homes and Apartment Units have with the Parcel Polygons. Polygons associated with CICs, Apartment Ownerships and Condominiums use the smallest Parcel Point PIN as their PIN and have attribute data limited information that is not unit specific (e.g., tax payer name and address information, tax and estimated market values are omitted). There are a few cases where polygons exist but there is no associated point, these include common areas associated with a CIC, parks or water; no official PIN exists for these polygons and there is no attribute data.",2014-12-01T18:34:09.000Z,2018-12-20T06:03:52.145Z,http://openramsey-ramseygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/3115ff609037465796604556843420be_33,https://maps.co.ramsey.mn.us/arcgis/rest/services/MapRamsey/MapRamseyOperationalLayersAll/MapServer/33,"-93.2284,44.8873,-92.9827,45.1245",05b-123,Minnesota,Counties Geospatial Data,{u'name': u'Map Portal'},"Ramsey County, Minnesota, United States|Minnesota, United States"

Methodology: US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) provided the sea level change (SLC) estimate-1. SLC was localized using water elevations collected from a qualifying-2 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) tidal reference station - NOAA observations were transformed from tidal datum to North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88). A final correction for glacial isostatic adjustment and land subsidence was applied to create an SLC value for the official project year, 2015. The best available LiDAR contributed to a county-wide Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The LiDAR-derived DEM is the base from which the SLC value is applied. A modified ?bathtub? model was employed to determine the areas likely inundated. All pixels in the DEM with an elevation value at or below the predicted SLC rate were reset to zero. To ensure the ?local minima? were excluded, a county network model of stream flowlines was created from the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). The connectivity of a predicted inundation area was tested against the network to ensure Atlantic Ocean and/or Chesapeake Bay influence.-1 The SLC rate used in this study was calculated using the USACE High Curve. See http://www.corpsclimate.us/ccaceslcurves.cfm for more detail.-2 Closest station with historic records of 40 years or greater.

The product forecasts areas of inundation and represents the new ?zero elevation? for the future scenario. Methodology: US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) provided the sea level change (SLC) estimate-1. SLC was localized using water elevations collected from a qualifying-2 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) tidal reference station - NOAA observations were transformed from tidal datum to North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88). A final correction for glacial isostatic adjustment and land subsidence was applied to create an SLC value for the official project year, 2015. The best available LiDAR contributed to a county-wide Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The LiDAR-derived DEM is the base from which the SLC value is applied. A modified ?bathtub? model was employed to determine the areas likely inundated. All pixels in the DEM with an elevation value at or below the predicted SLC rate were reset to zero. To ensure the ?local minima? were excluded, a county network model of stream flowlines was created from the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). The connectivity of a predicted inundation area was tested against the network to ensure Atlantic Ocean and/or Chesapeake Bay influence.-1 The SLC rate used in this study was calculated using the USACE High Curve. See http://www.corpsclimate.us/ccaceslcurves.cfm for more detail.-2 Closest station with historic records of 40 years or greater. An average or qualifying stations was chosen when the nearest station?s records were insufficient.?Map Service Layer Link:https://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Weather/MD_SeaLevelChangeHighCurveModel/MapServer/3**Please note, due to the size of this dataset, you may receive an error message when trying to download the dataset.

Light detection and ranging is the science of using a laser to measure distances to specific points. A specially equipped airplane with positioning tools and LiDAR technology was used to measure the distance to the surface of the earth to determine ground elevation. The classified points were developed using data collected in April to May 2007. The LiDAR points, specialized software, and technology provide the ability to create a high precision three-dimensional digital elevation and/or terrain models (DEM/DTM). The use of LiDAR significantly reduces the cost for developing this information.The DTMs are intended to correspond to the orthometric heights of the bare surface of the county (no buildings or vegetation cover).

MARS (ver. 8.0.4, build 8185) software was used to create the GeoTIFF images.The DSMs were developed using LiDAR data. LiDAR is an acronym for LIght Detection And Ranging. Light detection and ranging is the science of using a laser to measure distances to specific points. A specially equipped airplane with positioning tools and LiDAR technology was used to measure the distance to the surface of the earth. The classified points were developed using data collected in April to May 2007. The LiDAR points, specialized software, and technology provide the ability to create a high precision three-dimensional digital elevation and/or terrain models (DEM/DTM) as well as digital surface models (DSM). The use of LiDAR significantly reduces the cost for developing this information.The DSMs are intended to correspond to the orthometric heights of the surface of the county including above ground features such as buildings, vegetation cover, utility structures, vehicles ... etc. DSM data are used by county agencies and others to study drainage issues such as flooding and erosion; contour generation; slope and aspect; and hill shade images. Elevation data and models are used in several different ways including:Visualization representations of the elevation data. Examples include:-	A hillshaded or shaded relief image-	An image representing slope-	An image representing aspectAnalysis of the elevation data and analytical products which can be generated.

The SRPM was created using the ArcGIS 'Area Solar Radiation' geoprocessing tool. Due to the number of variables and parameters, the default values of the geoprocessing tool were used.The solar radiation analysis tools in the ArcGIS Spatial Analyst extension enables one to map and analyze the effects of the sun over a geographic area for specific time periods. It accounts for atmospheric effects, site latitude and elevation, steepness (slope) and compass direction (aspect), daily and seasonal shifts of the sun angle, and effects of shadows cast by surrounding topography.

This was created using all points (excluding NOISE) from our 2007 LiDAR data without incorporating the breaklines. Merrick and Co. MARS (ver. 8.0.4, build 8185) software was used to create the GeoTIFF images.The DSMs were developed using LiDAR data. LiDAR is an acronym for LIght Detection And Ranging. Light detection and ranging is the science of using a laser to measure distances to specific points. A specially equipped airplane with positioning tools and LiDAR technology was used to measure the distance to the surface of the earth. The classified points were developed using data collected in April to May 2007. The LiDAR points, specialized software, and technology provide the ability to create a high precision three-dimensional digital elevation and/or terrain models (DEM/DTM) as well as digital surface models (DSM). The use of LiDAR significantly reduces the cost for developing this information.The DSMs are intended to correspond to the orthometric heights of the surface of the county including above ground features such as buildings, vegetation cover, utility structures, vehicles ... etc. DSM data are used by county agencies and others to study drainage issues such as flooding and erosion; contour generation; slope and aspect; and hill shade images. Elevation data and models are used in several different ways including:Visualization representations of the elevation data. Examples include:-	A hillshaded or shaded relief image-	An image representing slope-	An image representing aspectAnalysis of the elevation data and analytical products which can be generated. Examples include:-	Viewshed calculations for visibility and line-of-sight analysis-	Areas of highest Solar energy potential-	Uses in disaster management-	Industrial planning-	Calculation of cartographic contours-	Calculation of profiles along straight lines or line segmentsThese data are derived from other data sources, no accuracy measurements or tests were conducted.

The use of LiDAR significantly reduces the cost for developing this information.The DSMs are intended to correspond to the orthometric heights of the surface of the county including above ground features such as buildings, vegetation cover, utility structures, vehicles ... etc. DSM data are used by county agencies and others to study drainage issues such as flooding and erosion; contour generation; slope and aspect; and hill shade images. Elevation data and models are used in several different ways including:Visualization representations of the elevation data. Examples include:-	A hillshaded or shaded relief image-	An image representing slope-	An image representing aspectAnalysis of the elevation data and analytical products which can be generated. Examples include:-	Viewshed calculations for visibility and line-of-sight analysis-	Areas of highest Solar energy potential-	Uses in disaster management-	Industrial planning-	Calculation of cartographic contours-	Calculation of profiles along straight lines or line segmentsThese data are derived from other data sources, no accuracy measurements or tests were conducted. Primary use and intent for these data are for visualizations and topographic analysis.

Due to the lack of sufficient camera calibration information, errors will increase towards the margin of each underlying photo, although this effect has been minimized by cropping individual photos to make this mosaic. Since these photos were scanned from old film, local distortions (from the media stretching and/or shrinking) may be present as well as fading. Parts of the county were not captured including some areas in Buffalo Grove, Highland Park, and Riverwoods. The date of the flight means that most trees have fully leaf-out canopies, which obscure some ground features. This flight took place during a period of high population growth and land use change.

Green infrastructure
is a large-scale initiative for the 21st century. The objective is to transform
Lake County communities into sustainable centers by identifying an
interconnected system of landscapes to preserve natural habitats, protect
biodiversity, and promote healthier lifestyles. Green infrastructure can
improve our quality life, while supporting intelligent, balanced economic
growth across communities.

Caution should be used in interpreting features in this photography with reference to current conditions. In particular, many roads and road intersections have been realigned in the more than 60 years since this photography was taken. This historic aerial photography was captured in digital form as the result of a cooperative project between the Illinois State Geological Survey and the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Mapping Division of the Lake County Department of Information Technology. It is part of a statewide program to preserve the oldest known extensive aerial photography for future generations. The original photography was performed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as part of a nation-wide program for use in agricultural assessment.

MARS (ver. 8.0.4, build 8185) software was used to create the GeoTIFF images.The DSMs were developed using LiDAR data. LiDAR is an acronym for LIght Detection And Ranging. Light detection and ranging is the science of using a laser to measure distances to specific points. A specially equipped airplane with positioning tools and LiDAR technology was used to measure the distance to the surface of the earth. The classified points were developed using data collected in April to May 2007. The LiDAR points, specialized software, and technology provide the ability to create a high precision three-dimensional digital elevation and/or terrain models (DEM/DTM) as well as digital surface models (DSM). The use of LiDAR significantly reduces the cost for developing this information.The DSMs are intended to correspond to the orthometric heights of the surface of the county including above ground features such as buildings, vegetation cover, utility structures, vehicles ... etc. DSM data are used by county agencies and others to study drainage issues such as flooding and erosion; contour generation; slope and aspect; and hill shade images. Elevation data and models are used in several different ways including:Visualization representations of the elevation data. Examples include:-	A hillshaded or shaded relief image-	An image representing slope-	An image representing aspectAnalysis of the elevation data and analytical products which can be generated.

The use of LiDAR significantly reduces the cost for developing this information.The DSMs are intended to correspond to the orthometric heights of the surface of the county including above ground features such as buildings, vegetation cover, utility structures, vehicles ... etc. DSM data are used by county agencies and others to study drainage issues such as flooding and erosion; contour generation; slope and aspect; and hill shade images.

This was created using all points (excluding NOISE) from our 2007 LiDAR data without incorporating the breaklines. Merrick and Co. MARS (ver. 8.0.4, build 8185) software was used to create the GeoTIFF images.The DSMs were developed using LiDAR data. LiDAR is an acronym for LIght Detection And Ranging. Light detection and ranging is the science of using a laser to measure distances to specific points. A specially equipped airplane with positioning tools and LiDAR technology was used to measure the distance to the surface of the earth. The classified points were developed using data collected in April to May 2007. The LiDAR points, specialized software, and technology provide the ability to create a high precision three-dimensional digital elevation and/or terrain models (DEM/DTM) as well as digital surface models (DSM). The use of LiDAR significantly reduces the cost for developing this information.The DSMs are intended to correspond to the orthometric heights of the surface of the county including above ground features such as buildings, vegetation cover, utility structures, vehicles ... etc. DSM data are used by county agencies and others to study drainage issues such as flooding and erosion; contour generation; slope and aspect; and hill shade images. Elevation data and models are used in several different ways including:Visualization representations of the elevation data. Examples include:-	A hillshaded or shaded relief image-	An image representing slope-	An image representing aspectAnalysis of the elevation data and analytical products which can be generated. Examples include:-	Viewshed calculations for visibility and line-of-sight analysis-	Areas of highest Solar energy potential-	Uses in disaster management-	Industrial planning-	Calculation of cartographic contours-	Calculation of profiles along straight lines or line segmentsThese data are derived from other data sources, no accuracy measurements or tests were conducted.

This was created using the ground (class = 2) lidar points and incorporating the breaklines.The DTMs were developed using LiDAR data. LiDAR is an acronym for LIght Detection And Ranging. Light detection and ranging is the science of using a laser to measure distances to specific points. A specially equipped airplane with positioning tools and LiDAR technology was used to measure the distance to the surface of the earth to determine ground elevation. The classified points were developed using data collected in April to May 2007. The LiDAR points, specialized software, and technology provide the ability to create a high precision three-dimensional digital elevation and/or terrain models (DEM/DTM). The use of LiDAR significantly reduces the cost for developing this information.The DTMs are intended to correspond to the orthometric heights of the bare surface of the county (no buildings or vegetation cover). DTM data is used by county agencies to study drainage issues such as flooding and erosion; contour generation; slope and aspect; and hill shade images. This dataset was compiled to meet the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) Accuracy Standards for Large-Scale Maps, CLASS 1 map accuracy.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers?Engineering and Design Manual for Photogrammetric Production?recommends that data intended for this usage scale be used for any of the following purposes: route location, preliminary alignment and design, preliminary project planning, hydraulic sections, rough earthwork estimates, or high-gradient terrain / low unit cost earthwork excavation estimates.

This was created using all points (excluding NOISE) from our 2007 LiDAR data without incorporating the breaklines. Merrick and Co. MARS (ver. 8.0.4, build 8185) software was used to create the GeoTIFF images.The DSMs were developed using LiDAR data. LiDAR is an acronym for LIght Detection And Ranging. Light detection and ranging is the science of using a laser to measure distances to specific points. A specially equipped airplane with positioning tools and LiDAR technology was used to measure the distance to the surface of the earth. The classified points were developed using data collected in April to May 2007. The LiDAR points, specialized software, and technology provide the ability to create a high precision three-dimensional digital elevation and/or terrain models (DEM/DTM) as well as digital surface models (DSM). The use of LiDAR significantly reduces the cost for developing this information.The DSMs are intended to correspond to the orthometric heights of the surface of the county including above ground features such as buildings, vegetation cover, utility structures, vehicles ... etc. DSM data are used by county agencies and others to study drainage issues such as flooding and erosion; contour generation; slope and aspect; and hill shade images. Elevation data and models are used in several different ways including:Visualization representations of the elevation data. Examples include:-	A hillshaded or shaded relief image-	An image representing slope-	An image representing aspectAnalysis of the elevation data and analytical products which can be generated. Examples include:-	Viewshed calculations for visibility and line-of-sight analysis-	Areas of highest Solar energy potential-	Uses in disaster management-	Industrial planning-	Calculation of cartographic contours-	Calculation of profiles along straight lines or line segmentsThese data are derived from other data sources, no accuracy measurements or tests were conducted.
