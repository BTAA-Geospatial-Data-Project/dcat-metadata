The contours were developed using elevation data from the state of Iowa's LiDAR program.  The original 1 meter lidar grids were generalized to 3 meter resolution, and the contouring program applied with a 2 foot interval processed 10 feet at a time, so the program would have enough memory to complete.  Contour lines were simplified using a 2 foot tolerance, and lines less than 100 ft in length were discarded.  Ten foot index contours are identified in the attribute table.  Contours crossing water features sometimes have a triangular appearance due to lack of lidar returns over water and should be ignored.

6870520c-ce0d-4b6b-a9dc-0513468f2623,Surficial Geology of Iowa,"Surficial geologic maps portray the current interpretation of the distribution of various Quaternary stratigraphic units present at the land surface. These surficial deposits consist of a variety of glacial, alluvial, outwash, wind-blown (loess and eolian sand), and shallow to bedrock materials. Mappers utilize existing data sources including water well and drilling records, USDA NRCS soil survey data, aerial photography, DEMs, satellite imagery, landform characteristics, and LiDAR. Additional stratigraphic and unit characterization information is obtained through drilling new core holes specifically for these projects. Mapped stratigraphic intervals are portrayed primarily at the formation level. Each unit is characterized by distinctive lithology and landform features which are described in the map legends and metadata. IGS utilizes a landform sediment assemblage approach (LSA) for surficial mapping. Various landforms are the result of specific processes at work in the geologic system. Landforms typically have similar relief, as well as stratigraphic and sedimentologic characteristics. Recognition of the genetic relationship among landforms and their underlying sediment sequences allows one to generalize and map complex glacial terrains over areas of large extent. LSA?s provide an opportunity to associate landforms with their underlying sediment packages. These maps were completed as part of the USGS Statemap program.

The Iowa Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) Project collects location and elevation (X, Y, Z) data to a set standard for the entire state of Iowa.
LIDAR is defined as an airborne laser system, flown aboard rotary or fixed-wing aircraft, that is used to acquire x, y, and z coordinates of terrain and terrain features that are both manmade and naturally occurring. LIDAR systems consist of a light-emitting scanning laser, an airborne Global Positioning System (GPS) with attendant GPS base station(s), and an Inertial Measuring Unit (IMU).
The laser scanning system measures ranges from the scanning laser to terrain surfaces by measuring the time it takes for the emitted light (LIDAR return) to reach the earth's surface and reflect back to the onboard LIDAR detector.
The airborne GPS system ascertains the in-flight three-dimensional position of the sensor, and the IMU delivers precise information about the attitude of the sensor. The LIDAR system incorporates data from these three subsystems to produce a large cloud of points on the land surface whose X, Y, and Z coordinates are known within the specified accuracy.
This collection consists of ASCII files of bare earth elevations and intensity (x,y,z,i) and, LAS (version 1.0 lidar data interchange standard) binary files that include all 1st and last returns, intensity and bare earth classification.

""Designated wetland"" means land designated as a protected wetland by the United States department of the interior or the department of natural resources, including but not limited to a protected wetland as defined in section 456B.1, if the land is owned and managed by the federal government or the department of natural resources. However, a designated wetland does not include land where an agricultural drainage well has been plugged causing a temporary wetland or land within a drainage district or levee district.
As referenced in the foregoing definition, protected wetland is defined in Iowa Code subsection 456B.1(4) as follows:
4. ""Protected wetlands"" means type 3, type 4, and type 5 wetlands as described in circular 39, Wetlands of the United States, 1971 Edition, published by the United States department of the interior. However, a protected wetland does not include land where an agricultural drainage well has been plugged causing a temporary wetland or land within a drainage district or levee district.
Iowa Code paragraph 459.310(1)(b) provides:
b. A confinement feeding operation structure shall not be constructed if the confinement feeding operation structure as constructed is closer than any of the following:
Five hundred (500) feet away from a water source other than a major water source.
(2)     One thousand (1,000) feet away from a major water source.
(3)     Two thousand five hundred (2,500) feet away from a designated wetland.
Separation distances apply to all confinement feeding operations regardless of size and whether a permit is needed.
Open feedlots are separate and do not have any separation distances.
If there is already a confinement within 2,500 feet of an existing wetland, it will not prevent the designation from occurring.  For separation distances to other items (neighbors, towns, parks, etc.) - the confinement is grand fathered in since it was there before the separation distance was expanded.  It will work similarly in this case - a confinement could be there and be exempt from the 2,500 foot separation distance since it was there before the separation distance was imposed.  But no new confinements would be allowed in the 2,500 feet once the designation takes place.
A designated wetland will not be ""established"" if closer than 2,500 feet of an existing confinement.  Any wetlands created or restored on state or federal lands within 2,500 feet of an existing confinement will not be eligible for designation.
These separation distances do not apply If the Confinement Animal Feeding Operation Structure includes construction of a secondary containment barrier

The bedrock surface is buried by unconsolidated surficial sediments (mostly Quaternary) over most of its extent, but this surface coincides with the modern land surface in areas of bedrock exposure. The map is consistent with all available data including drill records and well samples, as well as surface bedrock exposures (both natural and man-made) and shallow-to-bedrock soils units (NRCS county soils maps). Mapped stratigraphic intervals are portrayed primarily at the group level (i.e., a grouping of bedrock formations), each characterized by distinctive lithologies (rock types) summarized in the map key and associated metadata. The distribution of bedrock units was mapped to conform to the current map of bedrock topography (elevation of the bedrock surface). The structural configurations of relevant stratigraphic datums were intercepted with the bedrock topographic surface to produce the map contacts. The line style shown on the bedrock geologic map qualitatively reflects both data density and degree of certainty of individual stratigraphic contacts. Detailed line work is possible in areas of modern bedrock exposure, but more generalized line work (smooth and more sweeping forms) is portrayed in areas of sparser data control. The new bedrock map is, in part, a revised and updated compilation of seven multi-county bedrock maps prepared between 1998 and 2004 as part of Iowa's STATEMAP program (funded through U.S. Geological Survey).

It has a spatial resolution of one meter, and a class resolution of 15 classes. The target year for the interpretation of the classification is 2009. The Imagery sources are the 2008 NAIP imagery, the 2009 NAIP imagery, and the Four band Spring imagery collected in 2007, 2009 and 2010. Three dates were used because previous experimentation had shown that using fewer dates lacked sufficient spectral information to produce a reasonably consistent classification at the level required. Because each of these imagery layers were collected at widely different dates, to produce consistent classifications required breaking the state into regions or ""tiles"" with consistent spectral character. More than 580 such tiles were utilized statewide. Each was independently processed, and separately interpreted and checked. The final products were mosaicked together, then broken out into county files, which is how the files are presented in the NRGIS Library. Although we have done the best job we could to maintain consistency between these many files, it is impossible to maintain absolute consistency in even a small set of files, let alone this large number. The LiDAR data utilized was created by subtracting the Bare Earth DEM from the First Return DEM, yielding a normalized elevation model, which represents the elevation above ground surface of buildings, trees and other vegetation. This layer made an important contribution to producing an accurate classification of buildings and forests. A series of post classification steps were performed to correct problems which were consistent enough to be remedied by this kind of solution. These included embedding rasterized roads, recoding certain shadows, and using the LiDAR to refine building footprints, among others.

39215fa6-2bd9-4c50-aed6-691110df2f5e,Bird Conservation Areas in Iowa,"The Bird Conservation Areas of Iowa are included in this dataset. The Bird Conservation Area (BCA) concept was first proposed by the Midwest Working Group of Partners In Flight (PIF) to maintain populations of breeding grassland birds. That has scince been expanded to include birds breeding in a variety of habitats, including grassland, wetland, woodland, and savanna. This concept is backed by research that suggests viable bird populations require conservation efforts at a landscape-oriented level. The present model BCA encompasses at least 10,000 acres of public and/or private lands that includes approximately 25% of the area as key bird habitat. For instance, in a designated grassland BCA, at least 25% of the total land cover should be some type of grassland. Each BCA also should include a large ""core"" area of protected high-quality habitat (typically at least 20% of the area), with a minimum 2,000 acre core area targeted. Around this core are private lands, plus additional public tracts, managed for good bird habitat or at least maintained to be ""neutral"" in how they affect bird life. Many of these outlying parcels should be 100 acres or more of contiguous targeted habitat to complete a ""matrix"" of quality habitat for specific priority birds.

Together, these two reports are known as Iowa's 2014 Integrated Report. Waterbodies in Iowa each have specific designations based on what they are commonly used for-recreation, such as swimming or fishing; drinking water; or maintaining a healthy population of fish and other aquatic life. Every two years, Iowa must report on its progress in meeting water quality goals to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The state prepares one report called the 305(b) Water Quality Assessment or 305(b) list. This 305(b) list categorizes waterbodies to reflect: those that meet all the designated uses (category 1), those in which data availability is insufficient to determine whether any or all designated uses are being met (categories 2 and 3), and those waters in which the water quality prevents it from fully meeting its designated use, and is thus considered ""impaired"". New impairments (or category 5 listings) are placed on the ""303(d) Impaired Waters Report"", commonly referred to as the ""impaired waters list."" This is named after section 303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act and means that the stream or lake needs a water quality improvement plan written (also known by a technical name, ""Total Maximum Daily Load,"" or ""TMDL""). The water quality improvement plan outlines water quality problems, identifies sources of the problem(s), identifies needed reductions in pollutants and offers possible solutions. Water quality improvement plans are approved by the EPA and then the waters are moved from the 303(d) list back to the 305(b) list as category 4 listings (waters considered impaired, but a water quality improvement plan has been written).

327b03d3-3381-4744-a96a-dd4e74094abf,Agricultural Drainage Wells in Iowa,"This geospatial shapefile depicts the locations, functionality, owners and other observered characteristics of Agricultural Drainage Wells in the State of Iowa.
Agricultural drainage wells are required to be registered both with the Iowa Department of Natural Resources as a part of the 1987 Groundwater Protection Act, and with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as a part of the Underground Injection Control Program. Subsequent to this amendment to Iowa Code, Senate File 473 was passed in 1997. The bill required ""owners or agricultural drainage wells to prevent surface water intake into the wells, provided for the closure of certain wells and the construction of alternative drainage systems, provided state assistance for closing agricultural drainage well, prohibited the construction and use of certain structures located in agricultural drainage well areas, provided for the assessment and collection of certain drainage district expenses, provided penalties, and provided an effective date"" for closures. This date was originally set as December 31, 1999 but was later amended to December 31, 2001.
In 1998, following this legislation, ADW locations were computed from legal descriptions available and by hand drawn locations on section maps. The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship performed field checking of the location and function of each ADW registered and developed a database from this information. This information was used to create the original version of the shapefile ""ag_drain_well"".
During the regulatory processes that led up to December 31, 2001, it was determined by EPA, IDALS, and IDNR that certain ADWs would be temporarily allowed to remain ""unclosed"" if it could be proven by landowners that no surface water could enter and drain through their ADWs. Landowners were required to apply for a temporary (valid for 10 years) ""Continued Water Use Permit"" in which they described the physical characteristics and condition of the ADW and their drainage areas (http://extension.agron.iastate.edu/Waterquality/adwfiles/adwform2.pdf ). The information recorded in these individual Continued Water Use Permits were then distilled into a master ADW EXCEL spreadsheet and updated as needed.
In 2008, as many of the continued water use permits approached expiration the IDNR and IDALS desired an updated version of the original ADW shapefile. The resulting updated ADW shapefile would be utilized to field check ADWs by IDNR Field Office Personnel in the winter of 2008 through the spring of 2009 to verify that active (i.e. not closed) ADWs were in compliance with State and Federal rules. An updated ADW shapefile was therefore created utilizing information from the abovementioned master ADW EXCEL file, Continued Water Use Permit Applications, and 1998 ADW shapefile. These data sources were aggregated to produce most of the attribute information. At the same time, locational information in this revised ADW shapefile was improved with the aid of sketches on aerial photo photocopies. These rough approximations of ADW locations were not available during the development of the 1998 ADW shapefile; they were created a year later by landowners while applying for Continued Water Use Permits. Utilizing these landowner sketches, the positions of active ADWs were compared to late 1930s, early 1990s, 2002, and 2006 orthophotography and repositioned (closed and reclassified ADWs were largely excluded from this revision). Additionally, some sites were further refined utilizing LiDAR elevational datasets. This second-generation GIS file was stored as an ESRI point shapefile called ""ag_drainage_wells.shp"", Edition 20080908.
Using the 20080908 Edition of the ADW shapefile, Field Office Personnel carried out their field checks of active ADWs in the winter of 2008 through the spring of 2009. Compliance issues, the condition as well as the status of the wells (closed, fully functioning, etc.) were noted by Field Office Staff and entered into the master ADW EXCEL spreadsheet. This edition of ""ag_drainage_wells.shp"" (Edition 20091104) incorporates the Field Office staffs' observations pertaining to active ADWs that were recorded over the course of 2008-09.

490c5d10-ced2-4adf-a547-341d189fe9cf,"Three Meter Digital Elevation Model of Iowa, Derived from LiDAR","This data set represents a digital elevation model (DEM) of the land surface of Adair County, Iowa, in the UTM projection, Zone 15, NAD83 horizontal datum, with elevation in centimeters NAVD 88 vertical datum.  The DEM has a horizontal resolution of 3 meters and was aggregated from one meter resolution elevation data from the state of Iowa's LiDAR program.  The aggregation process uses a 3x3 pixel moving average window, which helps to smooth out noise in the one meter data, but also softens sharp edges of landscape features such as ditches and ridges, which may be undesirable for some purposes.  The DEM was then Integerizied to shrink the size of the file, so final units are in centimeters.  Water features sometimes have a triangular appearance due to lack of lidar returns over water and should be ignored.

a03fb845-a24f-4007-839b-b0b5dbbf6a17,Coal Mines of Iowa,"Iowa Coal Mines compiles together information about past mining that was held by the State of Iowa including scanned copies of the mine maps and details about individual mines. The primary intent is to provide information to evaluate potential impacts to the land surface from the historic coal mines, although the data may also be useful for historical and scientific research. Coal was mined in Iowa beginning in the 1840's and ending in 1994. The mines operated in the southern and central areas of the state using both surface and underground methods. Based on available records, it is estimated that over 6,000 individual mines may have operated in Iowa during the state?s 150 year mining history. Approximately 3,000 of these mines can be located to at least one section with about half of those known as points only. The remaining mines leave some information about the area that they operated in. Starting about 1880, the Office of State Mine Inspectors was established to regulate the mining industry to help insure the miners? safety. One of the requirements enacted at that time was that the mines employing more than four miners would submit detailed mine maps to the State Mine Inspectors every other year. Many of the mines that were exempt from this requirement were very small, local mines that operated to supply a few households. A large number of these mines may not be represented in this dataset.
