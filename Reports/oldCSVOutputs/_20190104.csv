Due to the lack of sufficient camera calibration information, errors will increase towards the margin of each underlying photo, although this effect has been minimized by cropping individual photos to make this mosaic. Since these photos were scanned from old film, local distortions (from the media stretching and/or shrinking) may be present as well as fading. Parts of the county were not captured including some areas in Buffalo Grove, Highland Park, and Riverwoods. The date of the flight means that most trees have fully leaf-out canopies, which obscure some ground features. This flight took place during a period of high population growth and land use change.

d59b21f762c648869d4df3b3cb4d6ad4_0,12b-097,Lake County Wetland Inventory,,"Download In State Plane Projection Here.?The Lake County Wetland Inventory (LCWI) maps natural and artificial 
wetlands meeting definitions established by the federal agencies who 
work with the Lake County Geographic Information System staff to 
periodically review and update it. These agencies include the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service and the United States Army Corps of Engineers.

        The 1989 federal wetland delineation standards for offsite 
wetland mapping are used. This data was last published in March of 1993.
 This update includes changes to the previous version of LCWI including:
 adjust current wetland boundaries to omit development, including roads;
 to fine tune boundary placement where that was intended by the original
 delineation, in some cases, adjust the wetland to photographic features
 / signature; delete wetlands which the committee decided were mapped in
 error - for example, trees which were mistaken for wet areas; create 
polygons for newly delineated artificial wetlands; and newly delineated 
wetlands or farmed wetlands caused by the continued deterioration of the
 agricultural drain tile system and increased runoff due to 
urbanization.

        The LCWI is a useful tool for general planning and review 
purposes, but it does not take the place of an on-site delineation by a 
certified wetland specialist.

        High resolution (1 = 100') orthorectified aerial imagery 
captured in April 2002 was used as the base for this update. Other data 
used as reference for this update include: 2004 SOIL SURVEY GEOGRAPHIC 
(SSURGO) DATABASE FOR LAKE COUNTY, IL - U.S. Department of Agriculture, 
Natural Resources Conservation Service; HYDROLOGY2002 - Lake County 
GIS/Map Division; 2' topography (CONTOURS) - Lake County GIS/Map 
Division; and various years of historical aerial photography for 
clarification. By using the more recent higher resolution photography, 
the resulting updated wetland boundaries are more accurate then the

They were then scanned by the USGS and georeferenced by Lake County in 2007. This data should NOT be used at a scale larger than 1 inch = 400 feet. Due to the lack of sufficient camera calibration information, errors will increase towards the margin of each underlying photo, although this effect has been minimized by cropping individual photos to make this mosaic. Since these photos were scanned from old film, local distortions (from the media stretching and/or shrinking) may be present as well as fading. Parts of the county were not captured including some areas in Buffalo Grove, Highland Park, and Riverwoods. The date of the flight means that most trees have fully leaf-out canopies, which obscure some ground features. This flight took place during a period of high population growth and land use change.

Part 404(b)(1) of the Clean Water Act authorizes the USEPA and the US Army Corps of Engineers
 to identify in advance of specific permit requests aquatic sites which 
will be considered as areas generally unsuitable for disposal of dredged
 or fill material. This process is called an Advanced Identification or 
ADID. Under the ADID process identification of an area as generally 
unsuitable for fill does not prohibit applications for permits to fill 
in these areas. Therefore the ADID designation of unsuitability is 
advisory not regulatory.

        An ADID designation lets a potential applicant know in 
advance that a proposal to fill such a site is not likely to be 
consistent with the 404(b)(1) guidelines, and the USEPA will probably 
request permit denial.

        ADID wetland information is also useful in watershed 
planning, land use planning, public land acquisition programs, natural 
resource studies and other purposes.

        The wetland selection criteria and methodology are documented
 in the publication entitled Advanced Identification (ADID) Study, Lake
 County, Illinois. Final Report, November 1992 which is included in 
this download.

 culverts, and streams) and the outer boundary of the water feature 
areas (for example, lakes and ponds) of Lake County, Illinois. The 
features in the dataset include: dams, culverts, local drainage; and the
 outer boundary of lakes, ponds, detention/retention basins, 
river/streams/creeks greater than five feet wide, and islands.

        The data has not been field verified and errors and/or omissions may be present.

        The names used for the water bodies were collected from a 
number of sources including: existing datasets, historic maps and/or 
atlases, US Geologic Survey (USGS) Geographic Names Information System (GNIS),
 current and historical USGS topographic quadrangle maps, local 
publications on place names within the county, and platted subdivisions.

        The dataset was traced from aerial photography captured 
between April 13 and April 26, 2002. The water features were compiled 
using softcopy analytical stereoplotters. This dataset should meet 
National Map Accuracy Standards for a 1:1200 product and it is

They were then scanned by the USGS and georeferenced by Lake County in 2007. This data should NOT be used at a scale larger than 1 inch = 400 feet. Due to the lack of sufficient camera calibration information, errors will increase towards the margin of each underlying photo, although this effect has been minimized by cropping individual photos to make this mosaic. Since these photos were scanned from old film, local distortions (from the media stretching and/or shrinking) may be present as well as fading. Parts of the county were not captured including some areas in Buffalo Grove, Highland Park, and Riverwoods. The date of the flight means that most trees have fully leaf-out canopies, which obscure some ground features. This flight took place during a period of high population growth and land use change.

318e616ff0d14efe83927d8dd3bc1e12_0,12b-097,Tax Parcels,,"Download In State Plane Projection Here.?Parcel boundaries are developed from deeds, plats of subdivision and other
legal documents going back to the mid 1800's, following generally accepted
practices used in Public Land Survey System states, and following guidelines
established by the Illinois Department of Revenue and the International
Association of Assessment Officials. Lake County's parcel coverage is based on
resolving the accumulated evidence of all of the legal documents surrounding a
particular parcel or subdivision, and not the result of a countywide resurvey.
These parcel boundaries are intended to be a visual inventory of property for
tax and other administrative purposes; they are not intended to be used in
place of an on-site survey or for the precise determination of property corners
or PLSS features based on GIS coordinates. In Illinois, only a registered
professional land surveyor is authorized to determine boundary locations.

Included are the tax parcel boundaries, represented as polygons and
centroids, for all changes resulting from legal records submitted to the
Recorder of Deeds up to December 31st of the preceding year, as well as any
court orders, municipal annexations and other transactions which impact the tax
parcel boundaries. NOTE: The ONLY attribute included is the Property
Index Number, or PARCEL_NUM. Additional assessment attribute data can be
downloaded here.

This parcel layer is used for tax assessment purposes and for a variety of
other local government functions. It changes often, both spatially and in its
attribution, based on divisions or consolidations, the sale of property and
other transactions.

Example: PIN 08-17-304-014 can be interpreted as follows: Township 08,
Section 17, Block 304, Parcel 014. Note that the first digit of block,
3 in this example, signifies that the parcel lies in quarter
section 3. The quarter sections are labeled from 1 through 4, representing the
northwest, northeast, southwest and southeast quarter sections, respectively.

They were scanned in 2001, and georeferenced in 2002. This data should NOT be used at a scale larger than 1 inch = 400 feet. Due to the lack of sufficient camera calibration information, errors will increase towards the margin of each underlying photo, although this effect has been minimized by cropping individual photos to make this mosaic. Since these photos were scanned from paper prints, local distortions (from the media stretching and/or shrinking) may be present as well as pen marks and fading. Caution should be used in interpreting features in this photography with reference to current conditions. In particular, many roads and road intersections have been realigned in the more than 60 years since this photography was taken. This historic aerial photography was captured in digital form as the result of a cooperative project between the Illinois State Geological Survey and the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Mapping Division of the Lake County Department of Information Technology. It is part of a statewide program to preserve the oldest known extensive aerial photography for future generations. The original photography was performed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as part of a nation-wide program for use in agricultural assessment. Since the original negatives became unstable and were destroyed by the National Archives in the 1980s, only paper prints remain.

7b6c444907f341318a74274d2f7ce503,12b-097,2017 Lake County Aerial Color InfraRed (CIR) - NW Quarter,,"This three inch pixel resolution color infrared aerial photography was flown between March 11, 2017 and April 12, 2017. The files are provided in JPEG2000, an open format supported by most GIS and CAD software packages. Its intended usage for viewing is 1 = 100. The photography has been orthorectified to meet National Map Accuracy Standards for its capture scale. The images are georeferenced to the Illinois State Plane, Eastern Zone, using the NAD83 2011 horizontal datum. Color InfraRed (CIR) imagery allows users to see the electromagnetic spectrum beyond the visible range. It does this by using the visible spectrum (red, green, blue) and combining it with the Near InfraRed (NIR) spectrum.
