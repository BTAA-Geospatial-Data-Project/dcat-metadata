Methodology: US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) provided the sea level change (SLC) estimate-1. SLC was localized using water elevations collected from a qualifying-2 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) tidal reference station - NOAA observations were transformed from tidal datum to North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88). A final correction for glacial isostatic adjustment and land subsidence was applied to create an SLC value for the official project year, 2015. The best available LiDAR contributed to a county-wide Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The LiDAR-derived DEM is the base from which the SLC value is applied. A modified ?bathtub? model was employed to determine the areas likely inundated. All pixels in the DEM with an elevation value at or below the predicted SLC rate were reset to zero. To ensure the ?local minima? were excluded, a county network model of stream flowlines was created from the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). The connectivity of a predicted inundation area was tested against the network to ensure Atlantic Ocean and/or Chesapeake Bay influence.-1 The SLC rate used in this study was calculated using the USACE High Curve.

Find more information at?http://imap.maryland.gov.The feature layer supports Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA) leadership and planners as they endeavor to mitigate or prevent the infrastructure impacts of sea level change resulting from land surface subsidence and rising sea levels. The product forecasts areas of inundation and represents the new ?zero elevation? for the future scenario. Methodology: US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) provided the sea level change (SLC) estimate-1. SLC was localized using water elevations collected from a qualifying-2 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) tidal reference station - NOAA observations were transformed from tidal datum to North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88). A final correction for glacial isostatic adjustment and land subsidence was applied to create an SLC value for the official project year, 2015. The best available LiDAR contributed to a county-wide Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The LiDAR-derived DEM is the base from which the SLC value is applied. A modified ?bathtub? model was employed to determine the areas likely inundated. All pixels in the DEM with an elevation value at or below the predicted SLC rate were reset to zero. To ensure the ?local minima? were excluded, a county network model of stream flowlines was created from the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). The connectivity of a predicted inundation area was tested against the network to ensure Atlantic Ocean and/or Chesapeake Bay influence.-1 The SLC rate used in this study was calculated using the USACE High Curve.

MARS (ver. 8.0.4, build 8185) software was used to create the GeoTIFF images.The DSMs were developed using LiDAR data. LiDAR is an acronym for LIght Detection And Ranging. Light detection and ranging is the science of using a laser to measure distances to specific points. A specially equipped airplane with positioning tools and LiDAR technology was used to measure the distance to the surface of the earth. The classified points were developed using data collected in April to May 2007. The LiDAR points, specialized software, and technology provide the ability to create a high precision three-dimensional digital elevation and/or terrain models (DEM/DTM) as well as digital surface models (DSM). The use of LiDAR significantly reduces the cost for developing this information.The DSMs are intended to correspond to the orthometric heights of the surface of the county including above ground features such as buildings, vegetation cover, utility structures, vehicles ... etc. DSM data are used by county agencies and others to study drainage issues such as flooding and erosion; contour generation; slope and aspect; and hill shade images. Elevation data and models are used in several different ways including:Visualization representations of the elevation data. Examples include:-	A hillshaded or shaded relief image-	An image representing slope-	An image representing aspectAnalysis of the elevation data and analytical products which can be generated. Examples include:-	Viewshed calculations for visibility and line-of-sight analysis-	Areas of highest Solar energy potential-	Uses in disaster management-	Industrial planning-	Calculation of cartographic contours-	Calculation of profiles along straight lines or line segmentsThese data are derived from other data sources, no accuracy measurements or tests were conducted.

This was created using the ground (class = 2) lidar points and incorporating the breaklines.The DTMs were developed using LiDAR data. LiDAR is an acronym for LIght Detection And Ranging. Light detection and ranging is the science of using a laser to measure distances to specific points. A specially equipped airplane with positioning tools and LiDAR technology was used to measure the distance to the surface of the earth to determine ground elevation. The classified points were developed using data collected in April to May 2007. The LiDAR points, specialized software, and technology provide the ability to create a high precision three-dimensional digital elevation and/or terrain models (DEM/DTM). The use of LiDAR significantly reduces the cost for developing this information.The DTMs are intended to correspond to the orthometric heights of the bare surface of the county (no buildings or vegetation cover). DTM data is used by county agencies to study drainage issues such as flooding and erosion; contour generation; slope and aspect; and hill shade images.

The SRPM was created using the ArcGIS 'Area Solar Radiation' geoprocessing tool.

This was created using all points (excluding NOISE) from our 2007 LiDAR data without incorporating the breaklines. Merrick and Co. MARS (ver. 8.0.4, build 8185) software was used to create the GeoTIFF images.The DSMs were developed using LiDAR data. LiDAR is an acronym for LIght Detection And Ranging. Light detection and ranging is the science of using a laser to measure distances to specific points. A specially equipped airplane with positioning tools and LiDAR technology was used to measure the distance to the surface of the earth. The classified points were developed using data collected in April to May 2007. The LiDAR points, specialized software, and technology provide the ability to create a high precision three-dimensional digital elevation and/or terrain models (DEM/DTM) as well as digital surface models (DSM). The use of LiDAR significantly reduces the cost for developing this information.The DSMs are intended to correspond to the orthometric heights of the surface of the county including above ground features such as buildings, vegetation cover, utility structures, vehicles ... etc. DSM data are used by county agencies and others to study drainage issues such as flooding and erosion; contour generation; slope and aspect; and hill shade images. Elevation data and models are used in several different ways including:Visualization representations of the elevation data. Examples include:-	A hillshaded or shaded relief image-	An image representing slope-	An image representing aspectAnalysis of the elevation data and analytical products which can be generated. Examples include:-	Viewshed calculations for visibility and line-of-sight analysis-	Areas of highest Solar energy potential-	Uses in disaster management-	Industrial planning-	Calculation of cartographic contours-	Calculation of profiles along straight lines or line segmentsThese data are derived from other data sources, no accuracy measurements or tests were conducted.

These data were developed from LIDAR data obtained between April 16, 2007 and May 07, 2007, and further supplemented by break lines collected from aerial photography taken at the same time. The contours and the aerial photography meet National Map Accuracy Standards for a 1 inch = 100 foot product. The contours have been created to be cartographically pleasing, as such some generalization has been introduced as expected. The contours have been tested against the original LIDAR points and conforms to the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) Specifications and Standards Committee, 1990, ASPRS Accuracy Standards for Large-Scale Maps, CLASS 1 map accuracy. The vertical datum is the North American Vertical Datum of 1988.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers?Engineering and Design Manual for Photogrammetric Production?recommends that data intended for this usage scale be used for any of the following purposes: route location, preliminary alignment and design, preliminary project planning, hydraulic sections, rough earthwork estimates, or high-gradient terrain / low unit cost earthwork excavation estimates.
