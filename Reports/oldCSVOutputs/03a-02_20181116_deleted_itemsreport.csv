Data is derived from the snowplow AVL/GPS data feeds. ?This data is used for Iowa DOT's Winter Cost Calculator Application.?This data is updated every 15 minutes.?Note: All values estimated based on best-available data.Note: This is an Esri Feature Collection which is different than an Esri Feature Service. Feature Collections allow for high-availability. There are unique characteristics that need to be considered when using this data type:?It is a file-based data type so there is no REST endpoint. However, there is JSON that can be parsed out. See link at the bottom of this page.You cannot set a refresh interval in the map document, you must use the Info Summary Widget inside an application or hard-code the refresh in a custom application.The rotation setting gets wiped out each time the dataset is updated. When you add a feature collection to a new map, you will have to set the rotation. If you have an existing saved map this doesn?t apply to you.",2017-06-12T13:23:12.000Z,2018-10-31T18:27:06.048Z,http://public-iowadot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/ddfc74adaf8144aab55199b7e885f554,http://iowadot.maps.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/28753b531c3649db967df47641cd6629/data,"-96.783,40.259,-90.059,43.593",http://public-iowadot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/ddfc74adaf8144aab55199b7e885f554
