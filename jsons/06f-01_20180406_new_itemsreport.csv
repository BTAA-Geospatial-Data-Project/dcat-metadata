This data also adds new line work to the Michigan Geographic Framework to help identify shared use pathways that are not within road right-of-way (commonly referred to as trails).Furthermore it identifies existing and planned bike routes (local, county, regional, state, or national) and bicycle friendly roadways which may not have bicycle/pedestrian facilities or official hike-bike routes; but, due to a combination of low traffic volumes and low posted speed, are none-the-less more comfortable to travel on.",2018-03-27T14:47:29.000Z,2018-04-03T11:35:19.000Z,http://maps-semcog.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/e1679aa4658248f7b03ae8c9f1ec3216_0,https://arcgisserver.semcog.org/arcgis/rest/services/OpenData/BicycleNetwork/MapServer/0,"-84.1617,41.7089,-82.4123,43.1837"
