feature class were derived from the Oakland County Tax Parcel feature 
class. Each parcel was categorized by its land use. When a parcel has 
multiple land uses, the dominant land use is shown. Assessing 
records and orthophotography were the main sources used to attribute 
each tax parcel with land use information. The data was collected in 
2012. Key attributes are the land use and key pin (Sidwell 
number). Land Use stores the Land Use description for each parcel. The 
Key Pin is the unique Parcel Identification Number (Pin) used to link 
the parcel to the parcel attributes which are stored and maintained in 
Oakland County Land Records.The 2012 version of land use was 
created using the 2011 version as a primary source. It was assumed that 
if the Parcel Identification Number and the Use Code were equal in both 
years, then the land use did not change. Thus, only the parcels where a 
change occured had to be assigned a land use. To ensure the quality of 
the land use data, however, several types of use codes were manually 
checked again for this update to enusre the assigned use is still 
accurate. Also, reference data such as the Adult Care, Public Beach, and
 Recreation Land feature classes the were used to locate misrepresented 
parcels. The development process consists of three basic steps. 
First, parcels with use codes that are assumed to relate to a single 
land use are categorized as such. Second, parcels with a use code that 
is assumed to relate to more than one land use are manually classified 
using orthophotography and ownership as a reference. Lastly, tax 
parcels, right-of-way, and hydrography are unioned to create a single 
land use dataset.Assumptions: In 2005, Oakland County 
Equalization and many of the local assessors have changed from using the
 use codes described below to property class codes. These codes were 
interpreted to simliar use codes for the purpose of this data. One major
 change is that tax exempt property is no longer recorded using the ME,
 Miscellaneous Exempt use code, but are instead usually classifed as 
RV, Residential Vacant. The Taxable field was referenced to locate 
tax exempt property such as schools, churches, and governemnt-owned 
property during this land use update. Any parcel classified as 
vacant may be an accessory use to an adjacent, commonly owned, improved 
parcel. In this event, the vacant parcel is reclassified as the use of 
the adjacent, commonly owned, improved parcel. It should be noted, 
however, that parcels with use codes of RV, SV, and LV, that represent a
 single family vacant use, are exempt from this assumption. Parcels
 with an Equalization use code of RV, SV, or LV may include uses to be 
reclassified as Vacant or Recreation  Conservation (due to 
subdivision open space). These parcels are not manually checked. Queries
 are conducted to search for those parcels that are subdivision open 
space. The following strings are queried from the Owner1 and Owner2 
fields: *own* (unknown, homeowner), ass* (association, ass'n, etc), 
and park. The Equalization use code BI, Business Improved 
includes uses that are reclassified as Commercial/Office. Uses may also 
fall into Public/Institutional, however, all BI parcels are not manually
 checked for reclassification. The Equalization use code MM, 
Miscellaneous Business includes uses that are reclassified as Recreation
 and Conservation, Multiple Family, Commercial/Office, or Mobile Home 
Park. The Equalization use code ME, Miscellaneous Exempt 
includes uses that are reclassified as Recreation  Conservation, 
Public/Institutional, Transportation, Utility  Communication, 
Industrial (municipal landfills), or any Single Family classification. The
 Equalization use code KI, Condominium Improved includes uses that are 
reclassified as Multiple Family, Single Family, or Commercial/Office. Any
 parcel with an Equalization use code of FI, Farm Improved or FV, Farm 
Vacant is considered to be an active agricultural use. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of II, Industrial Improved is considered to be an industrial use. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FC, Farm Conservation is considered to be a recreational/conservation use. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of AI, Apartment Improved is considered to be a multiple family residential use. Any
 parcel with an Equalization use code of UI, Utility Improved is 
considered to be a transportation, utility, or communication related 
use. Parcels with an Equalization use code of DI, Developmental Improved are reclassified as Single Family or Vacant. Any
 parcel with an Equalization use code of DV for Developmental Vacant may
 be reclassified as Vacant, Recreation  Conservation, (golf 
courses) or Industrial (mining or extractive). Polygons in the 
ROW region of the parcel coverage will be classified as Recreation and 
Conservation, and Commercial/Office, Vacant, Road ROW, and Railroad ROW.
 Because of inconsistencies in Use Code data, unique uses, and 
the goal of creating an accurate coverage that is not limited by its 
metadata, there may be exceptions from these assumptions. Exceptions: There
 are nine isolated cases where the land use would be tremendously 
overstated if the whole parcel was shown in a single use. In these 
cases, the polygon was split to show the use of the rest of the parcel 
vacant. These parcels are listed below: 01-29-451-001 01-35-300-014 04-08-200-002 04-24-100-004 07-13-301-006 14-04-376-002 18-19-476-015 21-10-200-001 21-10-200-002",2016-10-16T18:42:06.000Z,2016-11-02T15:33:26.000Z,http://portal.datadrivendetroit.org/datasets/cc9c87adb75c4df8be74ee3fc0454ce8_12,https://gisservices.oakgov.com/arcgis/rest/services/Enterprise/EnterpriseLandUseMapService/MapServer/12,"-83.694337,42.426087,-83.074282,42.893598",http://portal.datadrivendetroit.org/datasets/cc9c87adb75c4df8be74ee3fc0454ce8_12

contained in this feature class were derived from data developed for the
 2004 Oakland County Natural Areas Report update. Each feature was 
assigned a priority of One, Two, or Three. Digital Landcover, 
orthophotography, and USGS quadrangle maps were the main sources used to
 identify each natural area. The data from the Oakland County Natural 
Areas update project was collected in 2004. Key attributes include 
Priority and TotalScore. Priority is a reflection of quality and 
indicates the level of priority to retain or conserve the natural state 
of the identified area.The NaturalArea2004 data should be distributed with the Oakland County Potential Conservation/Natural Areas Report - April 2004.

 P.O. Box 30444 8th Floor, Mason Bldg. Lansing, MI 48909-7944 This
 report identifies and ranks Potential Natural Areas remaining in 
Oakland County. Potential Natural Areas are defined as places on the 
landscape dominated by native vegetation that have various levels of 
potential for harboring high quality natural areas and unique natural 
features. In addition these areas may provide critical ecological 
services such as maintaining water quality and quantity, soil 
development and stabilization, pollination of cropland, wildlife travel 
corridors, stopover sites for migratory birds, sources of genetic 
diversity, and floodwater retention. However, the actual ecological 
value of these areas can only be truly ascertained through on the ground
 biological surveys. The process established by the Michigan Natural 
Features Inventory (MNFI) of identifying potential conservation areas 
can also be used to update and track the status of these remaining 
sites. The site map and ranking data can be used by local 
municipalities, land trusts, and other agencies to prioritize 
conservation efforts and assist in finding opportunities to establish an
 open space system of linked natural areas throughout Oakland County. In
 this report the term potential natural area has been used in place of
 the term potential conservation area. The substitution was made in 
order to convey to the reader a clearer picture of the type of sites 
that are being delineated. It is felt that more people have a better 
understanding of the term natural area. The term potential natural 
area, however, is not to be confused with the legal term dedicated 
Natural Area as described in Part 351, Wilderness and Natural Areas, of
 the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act of 1994 which 
gives land special legal protection.When using this information 
it is important to keep in mind that site boundaries and ranking are a 
starting point and tend to be somewhat general in nature. Consequently, 
each community, group or individual using this information should 
determine what additional expertise is needed in order to establish more
 exact boundaries and the most appropriate conservation efforts. Materials and Interpretation Methodology: Interpretation
 of the 25-township area in Oakland County was conducted by using 
digital aerial photography taken in 2002, Tax Parcel, and 2002 Oakland 
County Potential Conservation/Natural Areas provided by Oakland County's
 Planning and Economic Development Services Division. As the 
townships were methodically interpreted and digitized using this 
imagery, the same areas were examined using: Southeast Michigan Council 
of Governments (SEMCOG) 2000 digital landcover, Michigan Center for 
Geographic Information (MCGI) MI Geographic Framework Hydrography (v3b),
 and Michigan Natural Features Inventory (MNFI) Biotics Database. These 
additional data sources were used to enhance and corroborate the 
interpretation process. Delineation of sites was done through 
aerial photo interpretation, with emphasis placed on 1) intactness, 2) 
wetlands and wetland complexes, 3) riparian corridors, and 4) forested 
tracts. Delineation of sites during this phase of the process was done 
conservatively, such that the chance of capturing sites that may end up 
being eliminated upon closer inspection, was greater than the chance of 
omitting sites that should have been delineated. Sites were delineated 
by focusing on wetlands and forest tracts and eliminating as much 
development (including roads), active agriculture and old fields as 
possible. Boundaries typically were defined by hard edges such as roads,
 parking lots, developments, and railroad beds. All potential natural 
areas were identified and delineated regardless of size. Municipal 
boundaries were not utilized to delineate site boundaries unless the 
boundary corresponded to a defined hard edge, such as a road. Once all 
sites were delineated, sites under 20 acres were deleted. Following
 the aerial photo interpretation and the delineation of potential 
natural areas, a more rigorous level of examination was undertaken based
 upon specific scaled criteria to prioritize sites. The criteria used to
 first delineate the sites were translated to a numerical scale. Each 
site could then be assessed based upon the scaled criteria and a total 
calculated score, based upon the sum of the scores for each criterion.",2016-10-16T18:55:49.000Z,2017-06-12T21:16:41.429Z,http://portal.datadrivendetroit.org/datasets/c1c033d6115f41cc8bbdd90131121b95_0,https://gisservices.oakgov.com/arcgis/rest/services/Enterprise/EnterpriseNaturalFeaturesMapService/MapServer/0,"-83.694337,42.426087,-83.074282,42.893598",http://portal.datadrivendetroit.org/datasets/c1c033d6115f41cc8bbdd90131121b95_0

The goal of the survey was to collect data on property condition and vacancy.  The effort, called Motor City Mapping, leveraged relationships with the Rock Ventures family of companies and the Detroit Employment Solutions Corporation to assemble a dedicated team of over 200 resident surveyors, drivers, and quality control associates.  Data collection occurred from December 4, 2013 until February 16, 2014, and the initiative resulted in survey information for over 370,000 parcels of land in the city of Detroit, identifying condition, occupancy, and use. The data were then extensively reviewed by the Motor City Mapping quality control team, a process that concluded on September 30, 2014. ?The file contains the official certified results from the Winter 2013/2014 survey, including data on illegal dumping, fire damage, condition of a structure (from good to suggest demolition), existence of a structure or accessory structure, and whether there are improvements to lots with no structures.  The data collected by the survey formed the centerpiece of the Blight Removal Task Force?s report, ?Every Neighborhood has a Future?and It Doesn?t Include Blight.? We look forward to seeing how this data can lead to a deeper understanding of our great city.

The baseflow of a stream or river is the amount of groundwater discharged from an aquifer to the watercourse. This discharge occurs year-round, and fluctuates seasonally depending on the level of the water in the aquifer. Baseflow is supplemented by direct runoff during and immediately after precipitation or melt events, resulting in peaks on a hydrograph showing stream flow through time. The process of dividing these peaks into base flow and runoff is called hydrograph separation. Hydrograph separations were completed for all USGS stream- flow gaging stations in Michigan that had more than 10 years of daily records. Sites that were clearly affected by upstream impoundments (lakes, dams) were excluded. No attempt was made to detect or correct for trends in the data. This may lead to some errors in the comparison of streams with data from different time periods if there is an underlying temporal trend in the data, but inclusion of all records in the analysis was necessary to increase the data pool and provide better spatial coverage. Watersheds were delineated for each of the 208 stream-flow gaging stations, and various characteristics of each watershed, such as topographic relief, surficial geology, land cover, growing degree days, annual and winter-season precipitation, and others were tabulated. Regression modeling, described in the Technical Report, was used to estimate the baseflow for each steam segment of the 1:100,000-scale National Hydrography Dataset.More Metadata",2015-02-27T21:10:28.000Z,2017-06-05T16:26:16.348Z,http://portal.datadrivendetroit.org/datasets/e8e263ecfc634c56ac89adefd4a21454_3,https://gisago.mcgi.state.mi.us/arcgis/rest/services/OpenData/hydro/MapServer/3,"-90.3951,41.2769,-82.4174,47.4692",http://portal.datadrivendetroit.org/datasets/e8e263ecfc634c56ac89adefd4a21454_3

feature class were derived from the Oakland County Tax Parcel feature 
class. Each parcel was categorized by its land use. When a parcel has 
multiple land uses, the dominant land use is shown. Assessing 
records and orthophotography were the main sources used to attribute 
each tax parcel with land use information. The data was collected in 
2014. Key attributes are the land use and key pin (Sidwell 
number). Land Use stores the Land Use description for each parcel. The 
Key Pin is the unique Parcel Identification Number (Pin) used to link 
the parcel to the parcel attributes which are stored and maintained in 
Oakland County Land Records.The 2015 version of land use was created using the 2013 version as a 
primary source. It was assumed that if the Parcel Identification Number 
and the Use Code were equal in both years, then the land use did not 
change. Thus, only the parcels where a change occured had to be assigned
 a land use. To ensure the quality of the land use data, however, 
several types of use codes were manually checked again for this update 
to enusre the assigned use is still accurate. Also, reference data such 
as the Adult Care, Public Beach, and Recreation Land feature classes the
 were used to locate misrepresented parcels. The development 
process consists of three basic steps. First, parcels with use codes 
that are assumed to relate to a single land use are categorized as such.
 Second, parcels with a use code that is assumed to relate to more than 
one land use are manually classified using orthophotography and 
ownership as a reference. Lastly, tax parcels, right-of-way, and 
hydrography are unioned to create a single land use dataset. Assumptions: In
 2005, Oakland County Equalization and many of the local assessors have 
changed from using the use codes described below to property class 
codes. These codes were interpreted to simliar use codes for the purpose
 of this data. One major change is that tax exempt property is no longer
 recorded using the ME, Miscellaneous Exempt use code, but are instead
 usually classifed as RV, Residential Vacant. The Taxable field was 
referenced to locate tax exempt property such as schools, churches, and 
governemnt-owned property during this land use update. Any 
parcel classified as vacant may be an accessory use to an adjacent, 
commonly owned, improved parcel. In this event, the vacant parcel is 
reclassified as the use of the adjacent, commonly owned, improved 
parcel. It should be noted, however, that parcels with use codes of RV, 
SV, and LV, that represent a single family vacant use, are exempt from 
this assumption. Parcels with an Equalization use code of RV, 
SV, or LV may include uses to be reclassified as Vacant or Recreation 
 Conservation (due to subdivision open space). These parcels are 
not manually checked. Queries are conducted to search for those parcels 
that are subdivision open space. The following strings are queried from 
the Owner1 and Owner2 fields: *own* (unknown, homeowner), ass* 
(association, ass'n, etc), and park. The Equalization use code
 BI, Business Improved includes uses that are reclassified as 
Commercial/Office. Uses may also fall into Public/Institutional, 
however, all BI parcels are not manually checked for reclassification. The
 Equalization use code MM, Miscellaneous Business includes uses that are
 reclassified as Recreation and Conservation, Multiple Family, 
Commercial/Office, or Mobile Home Park. The Equalization use 
code ME, Miscellaneous Exempt includes uses that are reclassified as 
Recreation  Conservation, Public/Institutional, Transportation, 
Utility  Communication, Industrial (municipal landfills), or any 
Single Family classification. The Equalization use code KI, 
Condominium Improved includes uses that are reclassified as Multiple 
Family, Single Family, or Commercial/Office. Any parcel with an 
Equalization use code of FI, Farm Improved or FV, Farm Vacant is 
considered to be an active agricultural use. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of II, Industrial Improved is considered to be an industrial use. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FC, Farm Conservation is considered to be a recreational/conservation use. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of AI, Apartment Improved is considered to be a multiple family residential use. Any
 parcel with an Equalization use code of UI, Utility Improved is 
considered to be a transportation, utility, or communication related 
use. Parcels with an Equalization use code of DI, Developmental Improved are reclassified as Single Family or Vacant. Any
 parcel with an Equalization use code of DV for Developmental Vacant may
 be reclassified as Vacant, Recreation  Conservation, (golf 
courses) or Industrial (mining or extractive). Polygons in the 
ROW region of the parcel coverage will be classified as Recreation and 
Conservation, and Commercial/Office, Vacant, Road ROW, and Railroad ROW.
 Because of inconsistencies in Use Code data, unique uses, and 
the goal of creating an accurate coverage that is not limited by its 
metadata, there may be exceptions from these assumptions.Exceptions: There
 are nine isolated cases where the land use would be tremendously 
overstated if the whole parcel was shown in a single use. In these 
cases, the polygon was split to show the use of the rest of the parcel 
vacant.

feature class were derived from the Oakland County Tax Parcel feature 
class. Each parcel was categorized by its land use. When a parcel has 
multiple land uses, the dominant land use is shown. Assessing 
records and orthophotography were the main sources used to attribute 
each tax parcel with land use information. The data was collected in 
2015. Key attributes are the land use and key pin (Sidwell 
number). Land Use stores the Land Use description for each parcel. The 
Key Pin is the unique Parcel Identification Number (Pin) used to link 
the parcel to the parcel attributes which are stored and maintained in 
Oakland County Land Records.The 2015 version of land use was 
created using the 2014 version as a primary source. It was assumed that 
if the Parcel Identification Number and the Use Code were equal in both 
years, then the land use did not change. Thus, only the parcels where a 
change occured had to be assigned a land use. To ensure the quality of 
the land use data, however, several types of use codes were manually 
checked again for this update to enusre the assigned use is still 
accurate. Also, reference data such as the Adult Care, Public Beach, and
 Recreation Land feature classes the were used to locate misrepresented 
parcels. The development process consists of three basic steps. 
First, parcels with use codes that are assumed to relate to a single 
land use are categorized as such. Second, parcels with a use code that 
is assumed to relate to more than one land use are manually classified 
using orthophotography and ownership as a reference. Lastly, tax 
parcels, right-of-way, and hydrography are unioned to create a single 
land use dataset. Assumptions: In 2005, Oakland County 
Equalization and many of the local assessors have changed from using the
 use codes described below to property class codes. These codes were 
interpreted to simliar use codes for the purpose of this data. One major
 change is that tax exempt property is no longer recorded using the ME,
 Miscellaneous Exempt use code, but are instead usually classifed as 
RV, Residential Vacant. The Taxable field was referenced to locate 
tax exempt property such as schools, churches, and governemnt-owned 
property during this land use update. Any parcel classified as 
vacant may be an accessory use to an adjacent, commonly owned, improved 
parcel. In this event, the vacant parcel is reclassified as the use of 
the adjacent, commonly owned, improved parcel. It should be noted, 
however, that parcels with use codes of RV, SV, and LV, that represent a
 single family vacant use, are exempt from this assumption. Parcels
 with an Equalization use code of RV, SV, or LV may include uses to be 
reclassified as Vacant or Recreation  Conservation (due to 
subdivision open space). These parcels are not manually checked. Queries
 are conducted to search for those parcels that are subdivision open 
space. The following strings are queried from the Owner1 and Owner2 
fields: *own* (unknown, homeowner), ass* (association, ass'n, etc), 
and park. The Equalization use code BI, Business Improved 
includes uses that are reclassified as Commercial/Office. Uses may also 
fall into Public/Institutional, however, all BI parcels are not manually
 checked for reclassification. The Equalization use code MM, 
Miscellaneous Business includes uses that are reclassified as Recreation
 and Conservation, Multiple Family, Commercial/Office, or Mobile Home 
Park. The Equalization use code ME, Miscellaneous Exempt 
includes uses that are reclassified as Recreation  Conservation, 
Public/Institutional, Transportation, Utility  Communication, 
Industrial (municipal landfills), or any Single Family classification. The
 Equalization use code KI, Condominium Improved includes uses that are 
reclassified as Multiple Family, Single Family, or Commercial/Office. 
Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FI, Farm Improved or FV, 
Farm Vacant is considered to be an active agricultural use. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of II, Industrial Improved is considered to be an industrial use. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FC, Farm Conservation is considered to be a recreational/conservation use. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of AI, Apartment Improved is considered to be a multiple family residential use. Any
 parcel with an Equalization use code of UI, Utility Improved is 
considered to be a transportation, utility, or communication related 
use. Parcels with an Equalization use code of DI, Developmental Improved are reclassified as Single Family or Vacant. Any
 parcel with an Equalization use code of DV for Developmental Vacant may
 be reclassified as Vacant, Recreation  Conservation, (golf 
courses) or Industrial (mining or extractive). Polygons in the 
ROW region of the parcel coverage will be classified as Recreation and 
Conservation, and Commercial/Office, Vacant, Road ROW, and Railroad ROW.
 Because of inconsistencies in Use Code data, unique uses, and 
the goal of creating an accurate coverage that is not limited by its 
metadata, there may be exceptions from these assumptions.Exceptions: There
 are nine isolated cases where the land use would be tremendously 
overstated if the whole parcel was shown in a single use. In these

These totals were derived from aggregating 380,094 parcels to the 2010 Census Block Group level. Note that to ensure consistency with the Census geography boundaries for Detroit, a very small number of parcels on the city's border needed to be manually assigned to a particular geography. The number of such parcels can be seen in the Count_JoinCount0 field in the database.

Note that average condition was calculated by taking a weighted average of the number of structures in each block group. Individual parcels were weighted from 1 to 4, with 1 indicating good condition, and 4 indicating suggest demolition. These weighted totals formed the basis of the average condition calculations. Note that for Census Block Groups, any geography that had fewer than 10 structures surveyed was excluded from the average condition calculations due to insufficient sample size.

foreclosures. The county serves notice to any parcel that is more than three 
years delinquent on property tax payments, and these properties are then sold to 
the highest bidder in two auctions - one in early September, and one in October. 
While there have been some exceptions to this schedule (a June 2012 auction of 
unsold foremost among them), properties listed in the September tax auction 
represent a strong proxy for identifying the universe of tax-foreclosed 
properties.
This file identifies parcels within the City of Detroit that were 
listed in the September Wayne County tax foreclosure auction in any year from 
2002 through 2013. It contains information on year of foreclosure, as well as 
the total number of times that a property has been subject to tax foreclosure. 
The work to produce this dataset was conducted in September 2013, and the data 
were subsequently integrated into the Motor City Mapping project.

feature class were derived from the Oakland County Tax Parcel feature 
class. Each parcel was categorized by its land use. When a parcel has 
multiple land uses, the dominant land use is shown. Assessing 
records and orthophotography were the main sources used to attribute 
each tax parcel with land use information. The data was collected in 
2013.Key attributes are the land use and key pin (Sidwell 
number). Land Use stores the Land Use description for each parcel. The 
Key Pin is the unique Parcel Identification Number (Pin) used to link 
the parcel to the parcel attributes which are stored and maintained in 
Oakland County Land Records.The 2013 version of land use was 
created using the 2012 version as a primary source. It was assumed that 
if the Parcel Identification Number and the Use Code were equal in both 
years, then the land use did not change. Thus, only the parcels where a 
change occured had to be assigned a land use. To ensure the quality of 
the land use data, however, several types of use codes were manually 
checked again for this update to enusre the assigned use is still 
accurate. Also, reference data such as the Adult Care, Public Beach, and
 Recreation Land feature classes the were used to locate misrepresented 
parcels.The development process consists of three basic steps. 
First, parcels with use codes that are assumed to relate to a single 
land use are categorized as such. Second, parcels with a use code that 
is assumed to relate to more than one land use are manually classified 
using orthophotography and ownership as a reference. Lastly, tax 
parcels, right-of-way, and hydrography are unioned to create a single 
land use dataset.Assumptions:In 2005, Oakland County 
Equalization and many of the local assessors have changed from using the
 use codes described below to property class codes. These codes were 
interpreted to simliar use codes for the purpose of this data. One major
 change is that tax exempt property is no longer recorded using the ME,
 Miscellaneous Exempt use code, but are instead usually classifed as 
RV, Residential Vacant. The Taxable field was referenced to locate 
tax exempt property such as schools, churches, and governemnt-owned 
property during this land use update.Any parcel classified as 
vacant may be an accessory use to an adjacent, commonly owned, improved 
parcel. In this event, the vacant parcel is reclassified as the use of 
the adjacent, commonly owned, improved parcel. It should be noted, 
however, that parcels with use codes of RV, SV, and LV, that represent a
 single family vacant use, are exempt from this assumption.Parcels
 with an Equalization use code of RV, SV, or LV may include uses to be 
reclassified as Vacant or Recreation  Conservation (due to 
subdivision open space). These parcels are not manually checked. Queries
 are conducted to search for those parcels that are subdivision open 
space. The following strings are queried from the Owner1 and Owner2 
fields: *own* (unknown, homeowner), ass* (association, ass'n, etc), 
and park.The Equalization use code BI, Business Improved 
includes uses that are reclassified as Commercial/Office. Uses may also 
fall into Public/Institutional, however, all BI parcels are not manually
 checked for reclassification.The Equalization use code MM, 
Miscellaneous Business includes uses that are reclassified as Recreation
 and Conservation, Multiple Family, Commercial/Office, or Mobile Home 
Park.The Equalization use code ME, Miscellaneous Exempt includes
 uses that are reclassified as Recreation  Conservation, 
Public/Institutional, Transportation, Utility  Communication, 
Industrial (municipal landfills), or any Single Family classification.The
 Equalization use code KI, Condominium Improved includes uses that are 
reclassified as Multiple Family, Single Family, or Commercial/Office.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FI, Farm Improved or FV, Farm Vacant is considered to be an active agricultural use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of II, Industrial Improved is considered to be an industrial use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FC, Farm Conservation is considered to be a recreational/conservation use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of AI, Apartment Improved is considered to be a multiple family residential use.Any
 parcel with an Equalization use code of UI, Utility Improved is 
considered to be a transportation, utility, or communication related 
use.Parcels with an Equalization use code of DI, Developmental Improved are reclassified as Single Family or Vacant.Any
 parcel with an Equalization use code of DV for Developmental Vacant may
 be reclassified as Vacant, Recreation  Conservation, (golf 
courses) or Industrial (mining or extractive).Polygons in the 
ROW region of the parcel coverage will be classified as Recreation and 
Conservation, and Commercial/Office, Vacant, Road ROW, and Railroad ROW.Because
 of inconsistencies in Use Code data, unique uses, and the goal of 
creating an accurate coverage that is not limited by its metadata, there
 may be exceptions from these assumptions.Exceptions:There
 are nine isolated cases where the land use would be tremendously 
overstated if the whole parcel was shown in a single use. In these 
cases, the polygon was split to show the use of the rest of the parcel 
vacant.

feature class were derived from the Oakland County Tax Parcel feature 
class.? Each parcel was categorized by its land use.? When a parcel has 
multiple land uses, the dominant land use is shown. ?Assessing 
records and orthophotography were the main sources used to attribute 
each tax parcel with land use information.? The data was collected in 
2008. ?Key attributes are the land use and key pin (Sidwell 
number).? Land Use stores the Land Use description for each parcel.? The
 Key Pin is the unique Parcel Identification Number (Pin) used to link 
the parcel to the parcel attributes which are stored and maintained in 
Oakland County Land Records.The 2008 version of land use was 
created using the 2007 version as a primary source.? It was assumed that
 if the Parcel Identification Number and the Use Code were equal in both
 years, then the land use did not change.? Thus, only the parcels where a
 change occured had to be assigned a land use.? To ensure the quality of
 the land use data, however, several types of use codes were manually 
checked again for the 2007 update to enusre the assigned use is still 
accurate.? Also, reference data such as the Adult Care, Public Beach, 
and Recreation Land feature classes the were used to locate 
misrepresented parcels.The development process consists of three
 basic steps.? First, parcels with use codes that are assumed to relate 
to a single land use are categorized as such.? Second, parcels with a 
use code that is assumed to relate to more than one land use are 
manually classified using orthophotography and ownership as a reference.
 Lastly, tax parcels, right-of-way, and hydrography are unioned to 
create a single land use dataset.Assumptions:In 2005, 
Oakland County Equalization and many of the local assessors have changed
 from using the use codes described below to property class codes.? 
These codes were interpreted to simliar use codes for the purpose of 
this data.? One major change is that tax exempt property is no longer 
recorded using the ME, Miscellaneous Exempt use code, but are instead 
usually classifed as RV, Residential Vacant.? The Taxable field was 
referenced to locate tax exempt property such as schools, churches, and 
governemnt-owned property during this land use update.Any parcel
 classified as vacant may be an accessory use to an adjacent, commonly 
owned, improved parcel.? In this event, the vacant parcel is 
reclassified as the use of the adjacent, commonly owned, improved 
parcel.? It should be noted, however, that parcels with use codes of RV,
 SV, and LV, that represent a single family vacant use, are exempt from 
this assumption.Parcels with an Equalization use code of RV, SV,
 or LV may include uses to be reclassified as Vacant or Recreation 
 Conservation (due to subdivision open space).? These parcels are not 
manually checked.? Queries are conducted to search for those parcels 
that are subdivision open space.? The following strings are queried from
 the Owner1 and Owner2 fields: *own* (unknown, homeowner), ass* 
(association, ass'n, etc), and park.The Equalization use code 
BI, Business Improved includes uses that are reclassified as 
Commercial/Office.? Uses may also fall into Public/Institutional, 
however, all BI parcels are not manually checked for reclassification.The
 Equalization use code MM, Miscellaneous Business includes uses that are
 reclassified as Recreation and Conservation, Multiple Family, 
Commercial/Office, or Mobile Home Park.The Equalization use code
 ME, Miscellaneous Exempt includes uses that are reclassified as 
Recreation  Conservation, Public/Institutional, Transportation, 
Utility  Communication, Industrial (municipal landfills), or any 
Single Family classification.The Equalization use code KI, 
Condominium Improved includes uses that are reclassified as Multiple 
Family, Single Family, or Commercial/Office. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FI, Farm Improved or FV, Farm Vacant is considered to be an active agricultural use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of II, Industrial Improved is considered to be an industrial use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FC, Farm Conservation is considered to be a recreational/conservation use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of AI, Apartment Improved is considered to be a multiple family residential use.Any
 parcel with an Equalization use code of UI, Utility Improved is 
considered to be a transportation, utility, or communication related 
use.Parcels with an Equalization use code of DI, Developmental Improved are reclassified as Single Family or Vacant.Any
 parcel with an Equalization use code of DV for Developmental Vacant may
 be reclassified as Vacant, Recreation  Conservation, (golf 
courses) or Industrial (mining or extractive).Polygons in the 
ROW region of the parcel coverage will be classified as Recreation and 
Conservation, and Commercial/Office, Vacant, Road ROW, and Railroad ROW.Because
 of inconsistencies in Use Code data, unique uses, and the goal of 
creating an accurate coverage that is not limited by its metadata, there
 may be exceptions from these assumptions.Exceptions:There
 are nine isolated cases where the land use would be tremendously 
overstated if the whole parcel was shown in a single use.? In these

feature class were derived from the Oakland County Tax Parcel feature 
class.? Each parcel was categorized by its land use.? When a parcel has 
multiple land uses, the dominant land use is shown. ?Assessing 
records and orthophotography were the main sources used to attribute 
each tax parcel with land use information.? The data was collected in 
2007. ?Key attributes are the land use and key pin (Sidwell 
number).? Land Use stores the Land Use description for each parcel.? The
 Key Pin is the unique Parcel Identification Number (Pin) used to link 
the parcel to the parcel attributes which are stored and maintained in 
Oakland County Land Records.The 2007 version of land use was 
created using the 2006 version as a primary source.? It was assumed that
 if the Parcel Identification Number and the Use Code were equal in both
 years, then the land use did not change.? Thus, only the parcels where a
 change occured had to be assigned a land use.? To ensure the quality of
 the land use data, however, several types of use codes were manually 
checked again for the 2006 update to enusre the assigned use is still 
accurate.? Also, reference data such as the Adult Care, Public Beach, 
and Recreation Land feature classes the were used to locate 
misrepresented parcels.The development process consists of three
 basic steps.? First, parcels with use codes that are assumed to relate 
to a single land use are categorized as such.? Second, parcels with a 
use code that is assumed to relate to more than one land use are 
manually classified using orthophotography and ownership as a reference.
 Lastly, tax parcels, right-of-way, and hydrography are unioned to 
create a single land use dataset.Assumptions:In 2005, 
Oakland County Equalization and many of the local assessors have changed
 from using the use codes described below to property class codes.? 
These codes were interpreted to simliar use codes for the purpose of 
this data.? One major change is that tax exempt property is no longer 
recorded using the ME, Miscellaneous Exempt use code, but are instead 
usually classifed as RV, Residential Vacant.? The Taxable field was 
referenced to locate tax exempt property such as schools, churches, and 
governemnt-owned property during this land use update.Any parcel
 classified as vacant may be an accessory use to an adjacent, commonly 
owned, improved parcel.? In this event, the vacant parcel is 
reclassified as the use of the adjacent, commonly owned, improved 
parcel.? It should be noted, however, that parcels with use codes of RV,
 SV, and LV, that represent a single family vacant use, are exempt from 
this assumption.Parcels with an Equalization use code of RV, SV,
 or LV may include uses to be reclassified as Vacant or Recreation 
 Conservation (due to subdivision open space).? These parcels are not 
manually checked.? Queries are conducted to search for those parcels 
that are subdivision open space.? The following strings are queried from
 the Owner1 and Owner2 fields: *own* (unknown, homeowner), ass* 
(association, ass'n, etc), and park.The Equalization use code 
BI, Business Improved includes uses that are reclassified as 
Commercial/Office.? Uses may also fall into Public/Institutional, 
however, all BI parcels are not manually checked for reclassification.The
 Equalization use code MM, Miscellaneous Business includes uses that are
 reclassified as Recreation and Conservation, Multiple Family, 
Commercial/Office, or Mobile Home Park.The Equalization use code
 ME, Miscellaneous Exempt includes uses that are reclassified as 
Recreation  Conservation, Public/Institutional, Transportation, 
Utility  Communication, Industrial (municipal landfills), or any 
Single Family classification.The Equalization use code KI, 
Condominium Improved includes uses that are reclassified as Multiple 
Family, Single Family, or Commercial/Office. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FI, Farm Improved or FV, Farm Vacant is considered to be an active agricultural use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of II, Industrial Improved is considered to be an industrial use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FC, Farm Conservation is considered to be a recreational/conservation use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of AI, Apartment Improved is considered to be a multiple family residential use.Any
 parcel with an Equalization use code of UI, Utility Improved is 
considered to be a transportation, utility, or communication related 
use.Parcels with an Equalization use code of DI, Developmental Improved are reclassified as Single Family or Vacant.Any
 parcel with an Equalization use code of DV for Developmental Vacant may
 be reclassified as Vacant, Recreation  Conservation, (golf 
courses) or Industrial (mining or extractive).Polygons in the 
ROW region of the parcel coverage will be classified as Recreation and 
Conservation, and Commercial/Office, Vacant, Road ROW, and Railroad ROW.Because
 of inconsistencies in Use Code data, unique uses, and the goal of 
creating an accurate coverage that is not limited by its metadata, there
 may be exceptions from these assumptions.Exceptions:There
 are nine isolated cases where the land use would be tremendously 
overstated if the whole parcel was shown in a single use.? In these 
cases, the polygon was split to show the use of the rest of the parcel 
vacant.?

These features were captured using a combination of a surface TIN derived from 10-foot contours and a detailed original map of Oakland County surficial geology by Twenter and Knutilla, 1972. Polygons were delineated on a hard-copy map by John Zawiskie, Cranbrook geologist. The map was then scanned and registered to Oakland County GIS data. The polygons were digitized on-screen. Data was collected at approximately 1:1200; however the original map was produced at a countywide scale. The key attribute is the geologic sediment type.The primary business purpose for the development of this data set was to collaborate with the Cranbrook Institute of Science in producing an educational map about the surficial geology of Oakland County at a scale appropriate to Countywide and sub-County applications. Prior work by Farrand and Bell (1982) mapped surficial geology deposits of the entire state; however the data is too coarse to have meaningful application at a county and sub-County scale. An improved data set was created by combining Oakland's detailed digital topography with a more detailed geology map. Secondary business purposes include natural resources planning and environmental analysis. For example, this map was used to create an aquifer vulnerability map analysis as part of a countywide water resources study conducted by the United States Geological Survey.These features were captured using a combination of a surface TIN derived from 10-foot contours and a detailed original map of Oakland County surficial geology by Twenter and Knutilla, 1972.

this dataset from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ). 
Pursuant to statutory guidelines under the Natural Resources and Environmental 
Protection Act (NREPA), the DEQ is required to 
?post on its website an inventory 
of residential closures and a separate inventory of other known 
facilities.? For the 
purposes of this dataset, 
?residential 
closures?have not been 
included; these were submitted to the DEQ in a No Further Action Report and 
satisfy remediation standards for Residential Facilities. 
All?other known facilities? 
available are included in the Inventory of Facilities 
dataset that serves as the foundation for this layer.

The Inventory of Facilities includes all locations 
where there have been a release of hazardous substances as defined under 
multiple subsets of NREPA. Although this list is commonly referred to as 
Brownfields, it can contain other types of designations including but not 
limited to: Leaking Underground Storage Tanks (LUST), Baseline Environmental 
Site Assessments (BEAs) and Environmental Site Assessments. Each of these 
designations requires further action, and the sites are pursuing cleanup in 
conjunction with the DEQ. 

It is also important to mention that this inventory 
does not necessarily include every facility that is subject to 
NREPA?s guidelines, since owners 
are not required to inform the DEQ about the facilities and can pursue cleanup 
independently. Facilities that are not known to the DEQ are not on the 
inventory, nor are locations with releases that resulted in little or no 
environmental impact.Metadata associated with this file includes?field description metadata?and a?narrative summary?detailing the creation of this dataset.For more information about the Motor City Mapping project, please visit www.motorcitymapping.org.",2014-11-26T20:22:08.000Z,2015-05-01T16:22:43.994Z,http://portal.datadrivendetroit.org/datasets/191098839f4e496aa167d2d600cad9c4_0,https://services2.arcgis.com/HsXtOCMp1Nis1Ogr/arcgis/rest/services/Brownfields/FeatureServer/0,"-83.28987452392992,42.266372619020046,-82.91110914849546,42.44857322946468",http://portal.datadrivendetroit.org/datasets/191098839f4e496aa167d2d600cad9c4_0

shapefiles on the City of Detroit's website to drawing polygons manually based
on descriptions from the Michigan State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO). D3
analysts then subjected the data to an extensive manual cleaning process,
removing duplicates and reconciling conflicting boundaries. The resulting
dataset contains boundaries for 656 features, including national, state, and

assistance to 18 states that were particularly impacted by the housing crisis 
that began in 2007. Michigan received nearly $500 million from this fund, which 
was initially intended to provide assistance to homeowners who were either 
unemployed or significantly underwater with their mortgage. However, given the 
high levels of blight in Detroit and other Michigan cities, some of the Hardest 
Hit Fund money was released to be used for structure demolition.
With the first phase of the program the City of Detroit received 
approximately $52 million, with the money to be spent by Spring 2015 in six 
target areas. The intent of the program was to conduct demolitions in more 
stable neighborhoods to ensure a higher impact of the limited funds that were 
available. However, these areas did not contain enough eligible properties for 
demolition in the time frame allotted for the money to be spent, so the Detroit 
Land Bank Authority expanded the Hardest Hit Fund program to include a number of 
other areas across Detroit. Through November 2014, the Hardest Hit Fund program 
has demolished nearly 2,400 structures in these targeted areas. ?This layer was acquired as part of Phase 2 of the Motor City Mapping project.An Excel sheet containing?field description metadata?is available for download. ?Follow the links in this description for more information on the Hardest Hit Fund program at both the?national level?and the?local level.",2014-12-29T15:07:36.000Z,2017-06-15T14:44:45.216Z,http://portal.datadrivendetroit.org/datasets/383eb730952e470389f09617b5448026_0,https://services2.arcgis.com/HsXtOCMp1Nis1Ogr/arcgis/rest/services/HHF_Areas_WithExpansion/FeatureServer/0,"-83.27745223685453,42.29386024431891,-82.90979025202566,42.449830745949114",http://portal.datadrivendetroit.org/datasets/383eb730952e470389f09617b5448026_0

this feature class were derived from the Oakland County Tax Parcel 
feature class.  Each parcel was categorized by its land use.  When a 
parcel has multiple land uses, the dominant land use is shown. 

Assessing records and orthophotography were the main sources 
used to attribute each tax parcel with land use information.  The data 
was collected in 2002. Key attributes are the land use and key 
pin (Sidwell number).  Land Use stores the Land Use description for each
 parcel.  The Key Pin is the unique Parcel Identification Number (Pin) 
used to link the parcel to the parcel attributes which are stored and 
maintained in Oakland County Land Records.The 2002 version of 
land use was created using the 2001 version as a primary source.? It was
 assumed that if the Parcel Identification Number and the Use Code were 
equal in both years, then the land use did not change.? Thus, only the 
parcels where a change occured had to be assigned a land use.The
 development process consists of three basic steps.? First, parcels with
 use codes that are assumed to relate to a single land use are 
categorized as such.? Second, parcels with a use code that is assumed to
 relate to more than one land use are manually classified using 
orthophotography and ownership as a reference. Lastly, tax parcels, 
right-of-way, and hydrography are unioned to create a single land use 
dataset.Assumptions:Any parcel classified as vacant may 
be an accessory use to an adjacent, commonly owned, improved parcel.? In
 this event, the vacant parcel is reclassified as the use of the 
adjacent, commonly owned, improved parcel.? It should be noted, however,
 that parcels with use codes of RV, SV, and LV, that represent a single 
family vacant use, are exempt from this assumption.Parcels with 
an Equalization use code of RV, SV, or LV may include uses to be 
reclassified as Vacant or Recreation  Conservation (due to 
subdivision open space).? These parcels are not manually checked.? 
Queries are conducted to search for those parcels that are subdivision 
open space.? The following strings are queried from the Owner1 and 
Owner2 fields: *own* (unknown, homeowner), ass* (association, ass'n,
 etc), and park.The Equalization use code BI, Business 
Improved includes uses that are reclassified as Commercial/Office.? Uses
 may also fall into Public/Institutional, however, all BI parcels are 
not manually checked for reclassification.The Equalization use 
code MM, Miscellaneous Business includes uses that are reclassified as 
Recreation and Conservation, Multiple Family, Commercial/Office, or 
Mobile Home Park.The Equalization use code ME, Miscellaneous 
Exempt includes uses that are reclassified as Recreation  
Conservation, Public/Institutional, Transportation, Utility  
Communication, Industrial (municipal landfills), or any Single Family 
classification.The Equalization use code KI, Condominium 
Improved includes uses that are reclassified as Multiple Family, Single 
Family, or Commercial/Office. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FI, Farm Improved or FV, Farm Vacant is considered to be an active agricultural use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of II, Industrial Improved is considered to be an industrial use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FC, Farm Conservation is considered to be a recreational/conservation use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of AI, Apartment Improved is considered to be a multiple family residential use.Any
 parcel with an Equalization use code of UI, Utility Improved is 
considered to be a transportation, utility, or communication related 
use.Parcels with an Equalization use code of DI, Developmental Improved are reclassified as Single Family or Vacant.Any
 parcel with an Equalization use code of DV for Developmental Vacant may
 be reclassified as Vacant, Recreation  Conservation, (golf 
courses) or Industrial (mining or extractive).Polygons in the 
ROW region of the parcel coverage will be classified as Recreation and 
Conservation, and Commercial/Office, Vacant, Road ROW, and Railroad ROW.Because
 of inconsistencies in Use Code data, unique uses, and the goal of 
creating an accurate coverage that is not limited by its metadata, there
 may be exceptions from these assumptions.Exceptions:There
 are nine isolated cases where the land use would be tremendously 
overstated if the whole parcel was shown in a single use.? In these 
cases, the polygon was split to show the use of the rest of the parcel 
vacant.? These parcels are listed below:???? 01-29-451-001???? 01-35-300-014???? 04-08-200-002???? 04-24-100-004???? 07-13-301-006???? 14-04-376-002???? 18-19-476-015???? 21-10-200-001???? 21-10-200-002",2016-10-16T18:12:21.000Z,2016-11-02T15:25:18.000Z,http://portal.datadrivendetroit.org/datasets/7e047939f8b148209da39ce0ad789a8b_2,https://gisservices.oakgov.com/arcgis/rest/services/Enterprise/EnterpriseLandUseMapService/MapServer/2,"-83.694337,42.426087,-83.074282,42.893598",http://portal.datadrivendetroit.org/datasets/7e047939f8b148209da39ce0ad789a8b_2

Agency that regulates hazardous air pollutants and ensures that construction and 
demolition activities are in compliance with federal regulations. As a part of 
this program, the State of Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) 
requires notification from all contractors conducting alterations (either 
rehabilitation or demolition) on structures that have the potential to contain a 
hazardous substance such as lead or asbestos, regardless of whether the 
structure is actually found to contain the hazardous material. Because of this 
requirement, NESHAP notifications are an excellent proxy for identifying 
structures that have been demolished.
This dataset contains information on NESHAP notifications that have 
been identified as tied to demolition activity. The notifications date from 2009 
through April, 2015, and have been sourced from the MDEQ's website as well as 
several tables obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request. The data 
contain information on the contractors for each demolition, the start and end 
date for the notification, and whether the property was surveyed as a 
residential structure in the 2009 Detroit Residential Parcel Survey.

feature class were derived from the Oakland County Tax Parcel feature 
class.? Each parcel was categorized by its land use.? When a parcel has 
multiple land uses, the dominant land use is shown. ?Assessing 
records and orthophotography were the main sources used to attribute 
each tax parcel with land use information.? The data was collected in 
2005. ?Key attributes are the land use and key pin (Sidwell 
number).? Land Use stores the Land Use description for each parcel.? The
 Key Pin is the unique Parcel Identification Number (Pin) used to link 
the parcel to the parcel attributes which are stored and maintained in 
Oakland County Land Records.The 2005 version of land use was 
created using the 2004 version as a primary source.? It was assumed that
 if the Parcel Identification Number and the Use Code were equal in both
 years, then the land use did not change.? Thus, only the parcels where a
 change occured had to be assigned a land use.The development 
process consists of three basic steps.? First, parcels with use codes 
that are assumed to relate to a single land use are categorized as 
such.? Second, parcels with a use code that is assumed to relate to more
 than one land use are manually classified using orthophotography and 
ownership as a reference. Lastly, tax parcels, right-of-way, and 
hydrography are unioned to create a single land use dataset.Assumptions:Any
 parcel classified as vacant may be an accessory use to an adjacent, 
commonly owned, improved parcel.? In this event, the vacant parcel is 
reclassified as the use of the adjacent, commonly owned, improved 
parcel.? It should be noted, however, that parcels with use codes of RV,
 SV, and LV, that represent a single family vacant use, are exempt from 
this assumption.Parcels with an Equalization use code of RV, SV,
 or LV may include uses to be reclassified as Vacant or Recreation 
 Conservation (due to subdivision open space).? These parcels are not 
manually checked.? Queries are conducted to search for those parcels 
that are subdivision open space.? The following strings are queried from
 the Owner1 and Owner2 fields: *own* (unknown, homeowner), ass* 
(association, ass'n, etc), and park.The Equalization use code 
BI, Business Improved includes uses that are reclassified as 
Commercial/Office.? Uses may also fall into Public/Institutional, 
however, all BI parcels are not manually checked for reclassification.The
 Equalization use code MM, Miscellaneous Business includes uses that are
 reclassified as Recreation and Conservation, Multiple Family, 
Commercial/Office, or Mobile Home Park.The Equalization use code
 ME, Miscellaneous Exempt includes uses that are reclassified as 
Recreation  Conservation, Public/Institutional, Transportation, 
Utility  Communication, Industrial (municipal landfills), or any 
Single Family classification.The Equalization use code KI, 
Condominium Improved includes uses that are reclassified as Multiple 
Family, Single Family, or Commercial/Office. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FI, Farm Improved or FV, Farm Vacant is considered to be an active agricultural use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of II, Industrial Improved is considered to be an industrial use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FC, Farm Conservation is considered to be a recreational/conservation use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of AI, Apartment Improved is considered to be a multiple family residential use.Any
 parcel with an Equalization use code of UI, Utility Improved is 
considered to be a transportation, utility, or communication related 
use.Parcels with an Equalization use code of DI, Developmental Improved are reclassified as Single Family or Vacant.Any
 parcel with an Equalization use code of DV for Developmental Vacant may
 be reclassified as Vacant, Recreation  Conservation, (golf 
courses) or Industrial (mining or extractive).Polygons in the 
ROW region of the parcel coverage will be classified as Recreation and 
Conservation, and Commercial/Office, Vacant, Road ROW, and Railroad ROW.Because
 of inconsistencies in Use Code data, unique uses, and the goal of 
creating an accurate coverage that is not limited by its metadata, there
 may be exceptions from these assumptions.Exceptions:There
 are nine isolated cases where the land use would be tremendously 
overstated if the whole parcel was shown in a single use.? In these

feature class were derived from the Oakland County Tax Parcel feature 
class.? Each parcel was categorized by its land use.? When a parcel has 
multiple land uses, the dominant land use is shown. ?Assessing 
records and orthophotography were the main sources used to attribute 
each tax parcel with land use information.? The data was collected in 
2004. ?Key attributes are the land use and key pin (Sidwell 
number).? Land Use stores the Land Use description for each parcel.? The
 Key Pin is the unique Parcel Identification Number (Pin) used to link 
the parcel to the parcel attributes which are stored and maintained in 
Oakland County Land Records.The 2004 version of land use was 
created using the 2003 version as a primary source.? It was assumed that
 if the Parcel Identification Number and the Use Code were equal in both
 years, then the land use did not change.? Thus, only the parcels where a
 change occurred had to be assigned a land use.The development 
process consists of three basic steps.? First, parcels with use codes 
that are assumed to relate to a single land use are categorized as 
such.? Second, parcels with a use code that is assumed to relate to more
 than one land use are manually classified using orthophotography and 
ownership as a reference. Lastly, tax parcels, right-of-way, and 
hydrography are unioned to create a single land use dataset.Assumptions:Any
 parcel classified as vacant may be an accessory use to an adjacent, 
commonly owned, improved parcel.? In this event, the vacant parcel is 
reclassified as the use of the adjacent, commonly owned, improved 
parcel.? It should be noted, however, that parcels with use codes of RV,
 SV, and LV, that represent a single family vacant use, are exempt from 
this assumption.Parcels with an Equalization use code of RV, SV,
 or LV may include uses to be reclassified as Vacant or Recreation 
 Conservation (due to subdivision open space).? These parcels are not 
manually checked.? Queries are conducted to search for those parcels 
that are subdivision open space.? The following strings are queried from
 the Owner1 and Owner2 fields: *own* (unknown, homeowner), ass* 
(association, ass'n, etc), and park.The Equalization use code 
BI, Business Improved includes uses that are reclassified as 
Commercial/Office.? Uses may also fall into Public/Institutional, 
however, all BI parcels are not manually checked for reclassification.The
 Equalization use code MM, Miscellaneous Business includes uses that are
 reclassified as Recreation and Conservation, Multiple Family, 
Commercial/Office, or Mobile Home Park.The Equalization use code
 ME, Miscellaneous Exempt includes uses that are reclassified as 
Recreation  Conservation, Public/Institutional, Transportation, 
Utility  Communication, Industrial (municipal landfills), or any 
Single Family classification.The Equalization use code KI, 
Condominium Improved includes uses that are reclassified as Multiple 
Family, Single Family, or Commercial/Office. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FI, Farm Improved or FV, Farm Vacant is considered to be an active agricultural use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of II, Industrial Improved is considered to be an industrial use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FC, Farm Conservation is considered to be a recreational/conservation use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of AI, Apartment Improved is considered to be a multiple family residential use.Any
 parcel with an Equalization use code of UI, Utility Improved is 
considered to be a transportation, utility, or communication related 
use.Parcels with an Equalization use code of DI, Developmental Improved are reclassified as Single Family or Vacant.Any
 parcel with an Equalization use code of DV for Developmental Vacant may
 be reclassified as Vacant, Recreation  Conservation, (golf 
courses) or Industrial (mining or extractive).Polygons in the 
ROW region of the parcel coverage will be classified as Recreation and 
Conservation, and Commercial/Office, Vacant, Road ROW, and Railroad ROW.Because
 of inconsistencies in Use Code data, unique uses, and the goal of 
creating an accurate coverage that is not limited by its metadata, there
 may be exceptions from these assumptions.Exceptions:There
 are nine isolated cases where the land use would be tremendously 
overstated if the whole parcel was shown in a single use.? In these 
cases, the polygon was split to show the use of the rest of the parcel 
vacant.?

federal poverty level at the zip code tabulation area (ZCTA) level. Each column 
beginning with a T_ lists the total number of families that fall into each 
income category. In addition, the dataset contains information on margins of 
error and the reliability of each estimate, to help guide decisionmakers in more 
effectively using the data contained in this file. There are approximately 1,000 
records in this dataset. ZCTA boundaries are designed to approximate actual zip

this feature class were derived from the Oakland County Tax Parcel 
feature class.  Each parcel was categorized by its land use.  When a 
parcel has multiple land uses, the dominant land use is shown. Assessing
 records and orthophotography were the main sources used to attribute 
each tax parcel with land use information.  The data was collected in 
2003. Key attributes are the land use and key pin (Sidwell 
number).  Land Use stores the Land Use description for each parcel.  The
 Key Pin is the unique Parcel Identification Number (Pin) used to link 
the parcel to the parcel attributes which are stored and maintained in 
Oakland County Land Records.The 2003 version of land use was 
created using the 2002 version as a primary source.? It was assumed that
 if the Parcel Identification Number and the Use Code were equal in both
 years, then the land use did not change.? Thus, only the parcels where a
 change occured had to be assigned a land use.The development 
process consists of three basic steps.? First, parcels with use codes 
that are assumed to relate to a single land use are categorized as 
such.? Second, parcels with a use code that is assumed to relate to more
 than one land use are manually classified using orthophotography and 
ownership as a reference. Lastly, tax parcels, right-of-way, and 
hydrography are unioned to create a single land use dataset.Assumptions:Any
 parcel classified as vacant may be an accessory use to an adjacent, 
commonly owned, improved parcel.? In this event, the vacant parcel is 
reclassified as the use of the adjacent, commonly owned, improved 
parcel.? It should be noted, however, that parcels with use codes of RV,
 SV, and LV, that represent a single family vacant use, are exempt from 
this assumption.Parcels with an Equalization use code of RV, SV,
 or LV may include uses to be reclassified as Vacant or Recreation 
 Conservation (due to subdivision open space).? These parcels are not 
manually checked.? Queries are conducted to search for those parcels 
that are subdivision open space.? The following strings are queried from
 the Owner1 and Owner2 fields: *own* (unknown, homeowner), ass* 
(association, ass'n, etc), and park.The Equalization use code 
BI, Business Improved includes uses that are reclassified as 
Commercial/Office.? Uses may also fall into Public/Institutional, 
however, all BI parcels are not manually checked for reclassification.The
 Equalization use code MM, Miscellaneous Business includes uses that are
 reclassified as Recreation and Conservation, Multiple Family, 
Commercial/Office, or Mobile Home Park.The Equalization use code
 ME, Miscellaneous Exempt includes uses that are reclassified as 
Recreation  Conservation, Public/Institutional, Transportation, 
Utility  Communication, Industrial (municipal landfills), or any 
Single Family classification.The Equalization use code KI, 
Condominium Improved includes uses that are reclassified as Multiple 
Family, Single Family, or Commercial/Office. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FI, Farm Improved or FV, Farm Vacant is considered to be an active agricultural use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of II, Industrial Improved is considered to be an industrial use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FC, Farm Conservation is considered to be a recreational/conservation use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of AI, Apartment Improved is considered to be a multiple family residential use.Any
 parcel with an Equalization use code of UI, Utility Improved is 
considered to be a transportation, utility, or communication related 
use.Parcels with an Equalization use code of DI, Developmental Improved are reclassified as Single Family or Vacant.Any
 parcel with an Equalization use code of DV for Developmental Vacant may
 be reclassified as Vacant, Recreation  Conservation, (golf 
courses) or Industrial (mining or extractive).Polygons in the 
ROW region of the parcel coverage will be classified as Recreation and 
Conservation, and Commercial/Office, Vacant, Road ROW, and Railroad ROW.Because
 of inconsistencies in Use Code data, unique uses, and the goal of 
creating an accurate coverage that is not limited by its metadata, there
 may be exceptions from these assumptions.Exceptions:There
 are nine isolated cases where the land use would be tremendously 
overstated if the whole parcel was shown in a single use.? In these 
cases, the polygon was split to show the use of the rest of the parcel 
vacant.?

2009. ?Key attributes are the land use and key pin (Sidwell 
number).? Land Use stores the Land Use description for each parcel.? The
 Key Pin is the unique Parcel Identification Number (Pin) used to link 
the parcel to the parcel attributes which are stored and maintained in 
Oakland County Land Records.The 2009 version of land use was 
created using the 2008 version as a primary source.? It was assumed that
 if the Parcel Identification Number and the Use Code were equal in both
 years, then the land use did not change.? Thus, only the parcels where a
 change occured had to be assigned a land use.? To ensure the quality of
 the land use data, however, several types of use codes were manually 
checked again for this update to enusre the assigned use is still 
accurate.? Also, reference data such as the Adult Care, Public Beach, 
and Recreation Land feature classes the were used to locate 
misrepresented parcels.The development process consists of three
 basic steps.? First, parcels with use codes that are assumed to relate 
to a single land use are categorized as such.? Second, parcels with a 
use code that is assumed to relate to more than one land use are 
manually classified using orthophotography and ownership as a reference.
 Lastly, tax parcels, right-of-way, and hydrography are unioned to 
create a single land use dataset.Assumptions:In 2005, 
Oakland County Equalization and many of the local assessors have changed
 from using the use codes described below to property class codes.? 
These codes were interpreted to simliar use codes for the purpose of 
this data.? One major change is that tax exempt property is no longer 
recorded using the ME, Miscellaneous Exempt use code, but are instead 
usually classifed as RV, Residential Vacant.? The Taxable field was 
referenced to locate tax exempt property such as schools, churches, and 
governemnt-owned property during this land use update.Any parcel
 classified as vacant may be an accessory use to an adjacent, commonly 
owned, improved parcel.? In this event, the vacant parcel is 
reclassified as the use of the adjacent, commonly owned, improved 
parcel.? It should be noted, however, that parcels with use codes of RV,
 SV, and LV, that represent a single family vacant use, are exempt from 
this assumption.Parcels with an Equalization use code of RV, SV,
 or LV may include uses to be reclassified as Vacant or Recreation 
 Conservation (due to subdivision open space).? These parcels are not 
manually checked.? Queries are conducted to search for those parcels 
that are subdivision open space.? The following strings are queried from
 the Owner1 and Owner2 fields: *own* (unknown, homeowner), ass* 
(association, ass'n, etc), and park.The Equalization use code 
BI, Business Improved includes uses that are reclassified as 
Commercial/Office.? Uses may also fall into Public/Institutional, 
however, all BI parcels are not manually checked for reclassification.The
 Equalization use code MM, Miscellaneous Business includes uses that are
 reclassified as Recreation and Conservation, Multiple Family, 
Commercial/Office, or Mobile Home Park.The Equalization use code
 ME, Miscellaneous Exempt includes uses that are reclassified as 
Recreation  Conservation, Public/Institutional, Transportation, 
Utility  Communication, Industrial (municipal landfills), or any 
Single Family classification.The Equalization use code KI, 
Condominium Improved includes uses that are reclassified as Multiple 
Family, Single Family, or Commercial/Office. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FI, Farm Improved or FV, Farm Vacant is considered to be an active agricultural use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of II, Industrial Improved is considered to be an industrial use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FC, Farm Conservation is considered to be a recreational/conservation use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of AI, Apartment Improved is considered to be a multiple family residential use.Any
 parcel with an Equalization use code of UI, Utility Improved is 
considered to be a transportation, utility, or communication related 
use.Parcels with an Equalization use code of DI, Developmental Improved are reclassified as Single Family or Vacant.Any
 parcel with an Equalization use code of DV for Developmental Vacant may
 be reclassified as Vacant, Recreation  Conservation, (golf 
courses) or Industrial (mining or extractive).Polygons in the 
ROW region of the parcel coverage will be classified as Recreation and 
Conservation, and Commercial/Office, Vacant, Road ROW, and Railroad ROW.Because
 of inconsistencies in Use Code data, unique uses, and the goal of 
creating an accurate coverage that is not limited by its metadata, there
 may be exceptions from these assumptions.Exceptions:There
 are nine isolated cases where the land use would be tremendously 
overstated if the whole parcel was shown in a single use.? In these 
cases, the polygon was split to show the use of the rest of the parcel 
vacant.? These parcels are listed below:???? 01-29-451-001???? 01-35-300-014???? 04-08-200-002???? 04-24-100-004???? 07-13-301-006???? 14-04-376-002???? 18-19-476-015???? 21-10-200-001???? 21-10-200-002",2016-10-16T18:36:10.000Z,2017-06-12T21:15:34.273Z,http://portal.datadrivendetroit.org/datasets/ed15ae6243974a6b8bc3c614055c0bd0_9,https://gisservices.oakgov.com/arcgis/rest/services/Enterprise/EnterpriseLandUseMapService/MapServer/9,"-83.694337,42.426087,-83.074282,42.893598",http://portal.datadrivendetroit.org/datasets/ed15ae6243974a6b8bc3c614055c0bd0_9

This feature class currently represents Downtown Development Authorities (DDA), Tax Increment Finance Authorities (TIFA), and Local Development Finance Authorities (LDFA); however, it will also depict Corridor Improvement Authorities (CIA) and Brownfield Redevelopment Authorities (BRA) in the future. These five types of authorities have the ability to capture tax increment financing (TIF).?The features were digitized using legal descriptions, parcel lists, and maps that were provided to the State of Michigan Office of the Great Seal and/or Oakland County Equalization by the authority. The key attributes are Name (official name of the authority), Type (the type of development authority), and DevelopmentPlan (yes/no indicating if the feature represents an area that is part of a development plan and can caputre tax increment financing).Tax Increment Financing is a tool used to promote redevelopment and community improvement projects by channeling funding toward projects in targeted areas. TIF is captured from the increase of property values from a base year. Millage rates from taxing jurisdictions are applied to the increased value. The resulting tax revenue is directed to the authority, rather than the appropriate jurisdiction.?Beginning in 1994, taxing jurisdictions have the option to opt out of having its taxes captured by the authority. Also since 1994, school taxes may no longer be captured unless they are necessary to make payments on existing eligible obligations. For more information about TIF, see Michigan Department of Treasury's Tax Increment Financing FAQ web page at http://www.michigan.gov/treasury/0,1607,7-121-3218---F,00.html. The State of Michigan has adopted enabling legislation to allow TIF through five types of authorities. Each type of authority has a focus relating to development/redevelopment: Downtown Development Authority (PA 197 of 1975)?Correct and prevent deterioration in business districtsEncourage historic preservationPromote economic growth of the districts Tax Increment Finance Authority (PA 450 of 1980)Prevent urban deteriorationEncourage economic development and activityEncourage neighborhood revitalization and historic preservationClosed to new applicants since 1987Allows the development of virtually any type of land use Local Development Finance Authority (PA 281 of 1986)Encourage local developmentPromote conditions of employmentPromote economic growthLimited to business activities involving:ManufacturingAgricultural processingHigh-technology activitiesEnergy productionBusiness incubators Brownfield Redevelopment Authority (PA 381 of 1996)Promote revitalization, redevelopment, and reuse of certain propertyFocus on tax reverted, blighted, or functionally obsolete propertyMDEQ must approve brownfield redevelopment areas Corridor Improvement Authority (PA 281 of 2005)Correct and prevent deterioration in business districtsEncourage historic preservationPromote economic growth of the districtsMust be adjacent to a road classified as an arterial or collectorThese quasi-public entities are created by resolution through a community's governing body. CIA and LDFA boundaries may cross municipal boundaries. In the case of these multi-jurisdictional authorities, both communities must pass resolutions establishing authority. There is currently only one Joint LDFA (Cities of Southfield and Troy) and there are no CIAs in Oakland County. When the community establishes the authority, it must also define the geographic boundaries in which it will operate. DDAs and CIAs are authorized to levy and collect taxes through a special assessment on all properties within the authority boundary.?After the authority and its boundaries are established, the authority creates a tax increment financing and development plan. The plan estimates the amount of tax increment financing that will be captured and lists specific projects on which it will be spent. It also defines the development area where the tax increment financing and projects will occur. The development area must be completely within the authority boundary; however, it may be coincident with the authority boundary.?An authority may contain multiple development areas, each with its own development and tax increment financing plan. BRAs normally designate development areas as a one or two parcels for a specific development project, while the other types of authorities define development areas as a larger area. Also, LDFAs are only allowed to capture TIF from parcels in a permitted use, such as manufacturing.?There may be both eliglible and inelgible parcels within a development area; however, the inelgible parcels do not participate in TIF capture. The base year used to calculate the amount of tax increment financing is set when the development plan is adopted. If the development plan is expanded at a later date, the base year could be reset for the entire development area or the capture could be calculated using multiple base years.?The source for the base year was the tax billing code used by Oakland County Equalization. When no tax billing code was available (for communities that don't use the county's assessing system), the community was contacted to obtain the base year. When two separate authorities overlap, each authority can establish overlapping development areas. The authority that first created the development area has first claim on tax increment financing capture.?Authority boundaries are represented using multiple features when the development area is not coincident with the authority boundary. One feature represents the development area and a second feature represents the remainder of the authority district that is not part of the development area. Multiple features are also used to represent authorities that have multiple development areas or development areas that have multiple base years.?Brownfield Redevelopment Authorities are unique in that the authority boundaries are generally defined as the entire municipality. For this reason, the non-development areas of BRA's have been excluded from this data. The following list shows communities in Oakland County that have established a BRA: City of Auburn Hills City of Birmingham City of Farmington City of Farmington Hills City of Ferndale City of Hazel Park Charter Township of Highland Village of Holly City of Madison Heights Village of Milford County of Oakland City of Oak Park City of Pontiac City of Rochester City of Rochester Hills Charter Twp of Royal Oak City of Royal Oak City of Southfield City of Troy Charter Township of Waterford?Source documents for the boundary of each feature were obtained from the State of Michigan Office of the Great Seal, Oakland County Equalization, and the Oakland County Treasurer's office. These could be in the form of a legal description, parcel list, and/or map.?For several boundaries, multiple sources were available and conflicted with each other. When this occurred, hierarchy was given to the legal description, then a parcel list, over the map, and the conflict is noted in the Comments field. However, if a parcel was shown in a parcel list, but not described in the authority based on the legal description, then it was still shown in the authority.It should also be noted that legal descriptions were not digitized using exact coordinate geometry. Instead, features were created by referencing the legal description to snap vertices to parcels, right-of-way, section corners, subdivisions, and lots. Features digitized from a legal description or map included road and railroad rights-of-way as it was described or shown in the document.For vague legal descriptions and parcel lists, right-of-way was addressed uniquely for each authority. Some source documents had statements that all or half of the surrounding right-of-way is to be included in the boundary, but some did not address right-of-way at all. In these cases, right-of-way was addressed distinctly for each authority based on the type of authority and the source documents with the method used recorded in the Comments field.?The data will be updated on an as needed basis when authorities amend their development plans or new authorities are established. Oakland County Equalization and the Oakland County Treasurer's Office will notify and forward the source documents of necessary revisions to Oakland County Planning and Economic Development Services who is the custodian of the feature class. Communities will be contacted annually to verify that the districts have not changed without the knowledge of county departments. In particular, county departments may not be aware of BRA development projects when no TIF is captured. Lastly, because the tax parcel feature class is revised periodically and it is important for the features to be coincident with the tax parcel feature class, the development authority feature class will also be updated annually to correct conflicts due to parcel shifting.",2016-10-16T17:43:51.000Z,2016-11-02T15:15:28.000Z,http://portal.datadrivendetroit.org/datasets/e90026448daa4d568daa3ef727d8d758_2,https://gisservices.oakgov.com/arcgis/rest/services/Enterprise/EnterpriseOpenPlanningMapService/MapServer/2,"-83.694337,42.426087,-83.074282,42.893598",http://portal.datadrivendetroit.org/datasets/e90026448daa4d568daa3ef727d8d758_2

In the fall of 2013, the Detroit Blight Removal Task Force commissioned 
Data Driven Detroit (D3), the Michigan Nonprofit Association, and LOVELAND 
Technologies to complete a survey of every parcel in the City of Detroit. This 
effort, called Motor City Mapping, leveraged relationships with the Rock 
Ventures family of companies and the Detroit Employment Solutions Corporation to 
assemble a dedicated team of over 200 resident surveyors, drivers, and quality 
control associates. From December 4, 2013, to February 16, 2014, the team 
collected data on over 370,000 properties, including information on use and 
condition of structures, fire damage, boarding, and the presence of dumping. 
This dataset formed the centerpiece of the Blight Removal Task Force's report, 
Every Neighborhood has a Future...and It Doesn't Include Blight.
Following the completion of the survey, D3 and LOVELAND have continued 
to collaborate on a second phase of the Motor City Mapping project, involving 
the build-out of a technology infrastructure intended to keep the data updated 
as conditions change across the city. LOVELAND issued a public release of the 
Blexting application used to conduct the initial survey, allowing Detroit's 
residents, workers, and community organizations to survey properties across the 
city. Responses, or blexts, are reviewed by a quality-control team to ensure 
that the information is consistent with the standards set forth by D3 and 
LOVELAND, and then are displayed publicly on www.motorcitymapping.org. This file 
consists of the most recent blext for each parcel through October 1, 2014, the 
date that responsibility for surveying and quality control transitioned from D3 
to LOVELAND.
In addition to the MCM dataset, D3 has enhanced this file with several 
other datasets, including 2014 tax foreclosures and delinquency, likely public 
ownership, and building footprint information. The tax foreclosure data flags 
properties that were likely headed to Tax Foreclosure as of August, 2014, while 
the tax delinquency data dates to June, 2014. Likely public ownership identifies 
properties identified by one of several sources as being owned by a public 
entity as of 2013/2014, while the building footprint information has been 
aggregated to parcel and dates to 2008.
Metadata accompanying this dataset includes?field description metadata?and a?narrative document?describing the process of creating the final 
file.
We look forward to seeing how this data can lead to a deeper 
understanding of Detroit! For more information about the Blight Removal Task

this feature class were derived from the Oakland County Tax Parcel 
feature class.  Each parcel was categorized by its land use.  When a 
parcel has multiple land uses, the dominant land use is shown. 

Assessing records and orthophotography were the main sources 
used to attribute each tax parcel with land use information.  The data 
was collected in 2001. 

Key attributes are the land use and key pin (Sidwell number).  
Land Use stores the Land Use description for each parcel.  The Key Pin 
is the unique Parcel Identification Number (Pin) used to link the parcel
 to the parcel attributes which are stored and maintained in Oakland 
County Land Records.The development process consists of three 
basic steps.? First, parcels with use codes that are assumed to relate 
to a single land use are categorized as such.? Second, parcels with a 
use code that is assumed to relate to more than one land use are 
manually classified using orthophotography and ownership as a reference.
 Lastly, tax parcels, right-of-way, and hydrography are unioned to 
create a single land use dataset.Assumptions:Any parcel 
classified as vacant may be an accessory use to an adjacent, commonly 
owned, improved parcel.? In this event, the vacant parcel is 
reclassified as the use of the adjacent, commonly owned, improved 
parcel.? It should be noted, however, that parcels with use codes of RV,
 SV, and LV, that represent a single family vacant use, are exempt from 
this assumption.Parcels with an Equalization use code of RV, SV,
 or LV may include uses to be reclassified as Vacant or Recreation 
 Conservation (due to subdivision open space).? These parcels are not 
manually checked.? Queries are conducted to search for those parcels 
that are subdivision open space.? The following strings are queried from
 the Owner1 and Owner2 fields: *own* (unknown, homeowner), ass* 
(association, ass'n, etc), and park.The Equalization use code 
BI, Business Improved includes uses that are reclassified as 
Commercial/Office.? Uses may also fall into Public/Institutional, 
however, all BI parcels are not manually checked for reclassification.The
 Equalization use code MM, Miscellaneous Business includes uses that are
 reclassified as Recreation and Conservation, Multiple Family, 
Commercial/Office, or Mobile Home Park.The Equalization use code
 ME, Miscellaneous Exempt includes uses that are reclassified as 
Recreation  Conservation, Public/Institutional, Transportation, 
Utility  Communication, Industrial (municipal landfills), or any 
Single Family classification.The Equalization use code KI, 
Condominium Improved includes uses that are reclassified as Multiple 
Family, Single Family, or Commercial/Office. Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FI, Farm Improved or FV, Farm Vacant is considered to be an active agricultural use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of II, Industrial Improved is considered to be an industrial use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of FC, Farm Conservation is considered to be a recreational/conservation use.Any parcel with an Equalization use code of AI, Apartment Improved is considered to be a multiple family residential use.Any
 parcel with an Equalization use code of UI, Utility Improved is 
considered to be a transportation, utility, or communication related 
use.Parcels with an Equalization use code of DI, Developmental Improved are reclassified as Single Family or Vacant.Any
 parcel with an Equalization use code of DV for Developmental Vacant may
 be reclassified as Vacant, Recreation  Conservation, (golf 
courses) or Industrial (mining or extractive).Polygons in the 
ROW region of the parcel coverage will be classified as Recreation and 
Conservation, and Commercial/Office, Vacant, Road ROW, and Railroad ROW.Because
 of inconsistencies in Use Code data, unique uses, and the goal of 
creating an accurate coverage that is not limited by its metadata, there
 may be exceptions from these assumptions.Exceptions:There
 are nine isolated cases where the land use would be tremendously 
overstated if the whole parcel was shown in a single use.? In these 
cases, the polygon was split to show the use of the rest of the parcel 
vacant.? These parcels are listed below:???? 01-29-451-001???? 01-35-300-014???? 04-08-200-002???? 04-24-100-004???? 07-13-301-006???? 14-04-376-002???? 18-19-476-015???? 21-10-200-001???? 21-10-200-002",2016-10-16T18:10:17.000Z,2017-06-12T21:17:37.958Z,http://portal.datadrivendetroit.org/datasets/714b7b2d17ec41a785db34d91b0ba711_1,https://gisservices.oakgov.com/arcgis/rest/services/Enterprise/EnterpriseLandUseMapService/MapServer/1,"-83.694337,42.426087,-83.074282,42.893598",http://portal.datadrivendetroit.org/datasets/714b7b2d17ec41a785db34d91b0ba711_1

Planning and Economic Development Services, other County departments, 
and and local communities for planning purposes.  The two major uses are
 cartographic output and creating summaries at various spatial extents.

The intent of this feature class was to provide a 
very general representation of a hard copy 1966 land use map.  The 
spatial accuracy and number of vertices used to represent each feature 
was limited by the intended purpose of the data.

The land use features were heads-up digitized from a 1966 land 
use map that was scanned and georefereneced using each section corner as
 a control point.  The features were digitized at a scale not greater 
than 1:15,000, one square-mile section at a time.  After the entire 
county was completely digitized, the features were dissolved based on 
the Landuse.

Right-of-Way was burned in to the final feature class using the 
following process.  First, the current RoadCenterline feature class was 
modifed to reflect roads in 1966 using the scanned 1966 land use map and
 1963 orthophotography as a reference.  Next, the road lines were 
buffered at specified distanced based on the RoadCode attribute from 
RoadCenterline to create polygons.  Major Roads were split into two 
types (Perscriptive Easement and Dedicated) based on if the adjacent 
property was platted prior to 1966.  According to the Oakland County 
Register of Deeds, in 1966 Oakland County was recording documents in 
liber 120.  For the purpose of this feature class it was assumed that 
simultaneous conveyances recorded in liber 120 or earlier existed in 
1966.  Major roads that intersected or were adjacent with these 
simultaneous conveyances were classified as Dedicated and the remainder 
of Major Roads were classified as a Perscriptive Easement.  The buffer 
distances, representing half the total Right-of-Way width, used for each
 road code are listed below:

     Minor Road - 30 feet
     Major Road (Perscriptive Easement) - 33 feet
     Major Road (Dedicated) - 46.5 feet
     State Highway - 46.5 feet
U.S. Highway - 46.5 feet
     Interstate - 60 feet feet

These Right-of-Way widths generally approximate 
those that actually existed in 1966 and are not intended to indicate the
 exact width of a specific Right-of-Way.  All areas completely 
surrounded by Right-of-Way such as between directions of travel of a 
boulevard or interstate or the area inside of a freeway interchange were
 manually attributed as Right-of-Way.

Water features were burned in the final feature class using a 
modified version the of the Oakland County Waterbody feature class.  
This data was modified to reflect waterbodies in 1966 using the 1966 
land use map and 1963 orthophotography as a reference.

Lastly, the features that intersected community boudaries were split 
using the Identity tool to increase cartographic and analytic 
performance.",2016-10-16T18:08:08.000Z,2016-11-02T15:23:07.000Z,http://portal.datadrivendetroit.org/datasets/f3b770fd11da46a5ada9a009eec23c9f_0,https://gisservices.oakgov.com/arcgis/rest/services/Enterprise/EnterpriseLandUseMapService/MapServer/0,"-83.694337,42.426087,-83.074282,42.893598",http://portal.datadrivendetroit.org/datasets/f3b770fd11da46a5ada9a009eec23c9f_0
