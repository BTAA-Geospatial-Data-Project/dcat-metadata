This data also adds new line work to the Michigan Geographic Framework to help identify shared use pathways that are not within road right-of-way (commonly referred to as trails).Furthermore it identifies existing and planned bike routes (local, county, regional, state, or national) and bicycle friendly roadways which may not have bicycle/pedestrian facilities or official hike-bike routes; but, due to a combination of low traffic volumes and low posted speed, are none-the-less more comfortable to travel on.",2017-01-06T13:08:09.000Z,2017-07-07T18:33:23.000Z,http://maps-semcog.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/83fc70460f324806bbb00b1bde17f5c1_0,http://arcgisserver.semcog.org/arcgis/rest/services/OpenData/Bicycle_Pedestrian_Facilities/MapServer/0,"-84.1617,41.7089,-82.4123,43.1837"
