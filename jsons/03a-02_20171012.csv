This list is supplemental to Iowa DOT's primary focus, Iowa's 5 Percent Safety Report. To develop this list, all crashes in Iowa are used to determine an initial cut of intersections that meet the criteria of at least one crash. The intersections identified are then ranked according to the number of crashes, the severity of the crashes, and the rate at which crashes occur. To read more details regarding Iowa's SICL, see Iowa SICL method.?The Iowa DOT utilizes crash reports filed by city police departments, county sheriffs, the Iowa State Patrol and individual drivers in determining the listings. The locations identified are eligible for funding assistance to develop safety improvements under the Iowa Traffic Safety Fund Program. Grant applications for funding are competitive and subject to comparison with the 5 percent severe safety needs list. The Iowa DOT will select proposals that provide the greatest safety return on the dollars invested. Proposals must be submitted to the Iowa DOT by June 15th each year to qualify for funding the following year. The Iowa Transportation Commission will consider and approve funding for selected locations during November and December.

Because of Iowa weather patterns, conditions can vary greatly in a small area; i.e., weather conditions a few miles away from the sensor could be completely different. In addition, failure of the sensors, or the equipment processing the information, may occur and produce unreliable information. Therefore, this information should not be used as the only factor in determining whether to travel in a particular area. The Iowa DOT recommends you check a number of sources, including media weather reports, in making your travel plans.Note: This is an Esri Feature Collection which is different than an Esri Feature Service. Feature Collections allow for high-availability. There are unique characteristics that need to be considered when using this data type:?It is a file-based data type so there is no REST endpoint.

This list is supplemental to Iowa DOT's primary focus, Iowa's 5 Percent Safety Report. To develop this list, all crashes in Iowa are used to determine an initial cut of intersections that meet the criteria of at least one crash. The intersections identified are then ranked according to the number of crashes, the severity of the crashes, and the rate at which crashes occur. To read more details regarding Iowa's SICL, see Iowa SICL method.?The Iowa DOT utilizes crash reports filed by city police departments, county sheriffs, the Iowa State Patrol and individual drivers in determining the listings. The locations identified are eligible for funding assistance to develop safety improvements under the Iowa Traffic Safety Fund Program. Grant applications for funding are competitive and subject to comparison with the 5 percent severe safety needs list. The Iowa DOT will select proposals that provide the greatest safety return on the dollars invested. Proposals must be submitted to the Iowa DOT by June 15th each year to qualify for funding the following year. The Iowa Transportation Commission will consider and approve funding for selected locations during November and December.

Check out the?Statewide Park and Ride System?application, found on the Iowa DOT Interactive Map Portal.The Iowa Department of Transportation?s park and ride system consists of state-owned park and ride lots. Many of these lots were developed during the 1980s, primarily in response to a growing demand that resulted from an increase in fuel prices. In most cases, lot development was truly the result of grassroots efforts, with Iowa DOT?s district offices often responding to specific public requests for park and ride facilities.As a part of the plan this database was created to geographically reference both existing state-owned park and ride facilities and ideal candidates for future expansion of the system. This database will also be used in coordination with the statewide rideshare program, so it will also include other existing park and ride facilities not owned by the state or identified in the plan. Ultimately this inventory has two main purposes that can be described generally as internal and external. Internally, the database will be used to keep track of state-owned inventory and identify opportunities for the expansion of the state-owned and operated park and ride system. Externally, the database will be expanded to include a wide array of park and ride facilities across the state of Iowa that can be disseminated to the public via the Iowa DOT website and coordinated with the rideshare program.",2016-06-15T15:38:46.000Z,2017-10-02T11:26:58.893Z,http://public-iowadot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/2ebedc750f1d4af18ea0c9edf6d4115f_0,https://gis.iowadot.gov/public/rest/services/Systems_Planning/Park_and_Ride/FeatureServer/0,"-96.5113,40.7057,-90.4629,43.4534",http://public-iowadot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/2ebedc750f1d4af18ea0c9edf6d4115f_0

The Iowa DOT recommends you check a number of sources, including media weather reports, in making your travel plans.Note: This is an Esri Feature Collection which is different than an Esri Feature Service. Feature Collections allow for high-availability. There are unique characteristics that need to be considered when using this data type:?It is a file-based data type so there is no REST endpoint. However, there is JSON that can be parsed out. See link at the bottom of this page.You cannot set a refresh interval in the map document, you must use the Info Summary Widget inside an application or hard-code the refresh in a custom application.The rotation setting gets wiped out each time the dataset is updated. When you add a feature collection to a new map, you will have to set the rotation. If you have an existing saved map this doesn?t apply to you.?",2017-09-25T17:04:29.000Z,2017-09-25T17:04:58.000Z,http://public-iowadot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/f27e72ed143c4696aebc460708def9b1,http://iowadot.maps.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/eb187b0424ea447eb0483479e1e1d3f3/data,"-180.0,-90.0,180.0,90.0",http://public-iowadot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/f27e72ed143c4696aebc460708def9b1

Identifies number of crashes and injuries on a county by county basis going back to 2001.?The Iowa DOT's Office of Traffic and Safety has updated a list of the top 1000 intersection safety improvement candidate locations (SICL) in Iowa. This list is supplemental to Iowa DOT's primary focus, Iowa's 5 Percent Safety Report. To develop this list, all crashes in Iowa are used to determine an initial cut of intersections that meet the criteria of at least one crash. The intersections identified are then ranked according to the number of crashes, the severity of the crashes, and the rate at which crashes occur. To read more details regarding Iowa's SICL, see Iowa SICL method.?The Iowa DOT utilizes crash reports filed by city police departments, county sheriffs, the Iowa State Patrol and individual drivers in determining the listings. The locations identified are eligible for funding assistance to develop safety improvements under the Iowa Traffic Safety Fund Program. Grant applications for funding are competitive and subject to comparison with the 5 percent severe safety needs list. The Iowa DOT will select proposals that provide the greatest safety return on the dollars invested. Proposals must be submitted to the Iowa DOT by June 15th each year to qualify for funding the following year. The Iowa Transportation Commission will consider and approve funding for selected locations during November and December.

This list is supplemental to Iowa DOT's primary focus, Iowa's 5 Percent Safety Report. To develop this list, all crashes in Iowa are used to determine an initial cut of intersections that meet the criteria of at least one crash. The intersections identified are then ranked according to the number of crashes, the severity of the crashes, and the rate at which crashes occur. To read more details regarding Iowa's SICL, see Iowa SICL method.?The Iowa DOT utilizes crash reports filed by city police departments, county sheriffs, the Iowa State Patrol and individual drivers in determining the listings. The locations identified are eligible for funding assistance to develop safety improvements under the Iowa Traffic Safety Fund Program. Grant applications for funding are competitive and subject to comparison with the 5 percent severe safety needs list. The Iowa DOT will select proposals that provide the greatest safety return on the dollars invested. Proposals must be submitted to the Iowa DOT by June 15th each year to qualify for funding the following year. The Iowa Transportation Commission will consider and approve funding for selected locations during November and December.

This list is supplemental to Iowa DOT's primary focus, Iowa's 5 Percent Safety Report. To develop this list, all crashes in Iowa are used to determine an initial cut of intersections that meet the criteria of at least one crash. The intersections identified are then ranked according to the number of crashes, the severity of the crashes, and the rate at which crashes occur. To read more details regarding Iowa's SICL, see Iowa SICL method.?The Iowa DOT utilizes crash reports filed by city police departments, county sheriffs, the Iowa State Patrol and individual drivers in determining the listings. The locations identified are eligible for funding assistance to develop safety improvements under the Iowa Traffic Safety Fund Program. Grant applications for funding are competitive and subject to comparison with the 5 percent severe safety needs list. The Iowa DOT will select proposals that provide the greatest safety return on the dollars invested. Proposals must be submitted to the Iowa DOT by June 15th each year to qualify for funding the following year. The Iowa Transportation Commission will consider and approve funding for selected locations during November and December.

This service feeds Iowa DOT's?WeatherView?ApplicationNote: This data is designed to be used with other RWIS feature services, like?RWIS_Atmospheric_Data?to get geometry.The weather data provided here by the Iowa Department of Transportation only reflects conditions at the specified site. Because of Iowa weather patterns, conditions can vary greatly in a small area; i.e., weather conditions a few miles away from the sensor could be completely different. In addition, failure of the sensors, or the equipment processing the information, may occur and produce unreliable information. Therefore, this information should not be used as the only factor in determining whether to travel in a particular area. The Iowa DOT recommends you check a number of sources, including media weather reports, in making your travel plans.Note: This is an Esri Feature Collection which is different than an Esri Feature Service. Feature Collections allow for high-availability. There are unique characteristics that need to be considered when using this data type:?It is a file-based data type so there is no REST endpoint. However, there is JSON that can be parsed out.

Purpose. ?It is the purpose of this section to enhance opportunities for the development and diversification of the state?s economy through the identification and improvement of a network of commercial and industrial highways. ?The network shall consist of interconnected routes which provide long distance route continuity. ?The purpose of this highway network shall be to improve the flow of commerce; to make travel more convenient, safe, and efficient; and to better connect Iowa with regional, national, and international markets. ?The commission shall concentrate a major portion of its annual construction budget on this network of commercial and industrial highways. ?In order to ensure the greatest possible availability of funds for the improvement of the network, primary highway funds shall not be spent beyond continuing maintenance for improvements to route segments that will be bypassed by the relocation of portions of the commercial and industrial highway network.	2. Network selection.a. The commission shall identify, within the primary road system, a network of commercial and industrial highways. ?The commission shall consider all of the following factors in the identification of this network:? ? ?i. The connection by the most direct routes feasible of major urban areas and regions of the state to each other and to the national system of interstate and defense highways and priority routes in adjacent states.? ? ?ii. The existence of high volumes of total traffic and commercial traffic.? ? ?iii. Long distance traffic movements.? ? ?iv. Area coverage and balance of spacing with service to major growth centers within the state.? ? ?v. Metropolitan area bypasses consistent with metropolitan or regional area plans established through cooperation by the department and local officials.b. The network of commercial and industrial highways shall not exceed two thousand ?six hundred miles including municipal extensions of these highways.	3. Standards. ?The department shall establish standards pertaining to the specific location, design, and access control for each segment of the commercial and industrial highways.	4. Network development. ?In establishing priorities for improvement projects, the department shall take into consideration the following additional criteria: ?urban area bypasses that improve urban or regional accessibility or improve corridor travel; projects consistent with regional or metropolitan transportation plans established through cooperation by the department and local officials; and the willingness of local officials to provide financial or other assistance for the development of projects.Source: Iowa Code Section 313.2A Primary Roads: Commercial and Industrial Highways. http://search.legis.state.ia.us/nxt/gateway.dll/ic/1/13/10856/10857/11188/11191?f=templatesfn=default.htm.",2016-11-08T18:04:29.000Z,2017-05-19T16:31:35.000Z,http://public-iowadot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/08103b01d0414cdd97e9407fe067ed51_3,https://gis.iowadot.gov/public/rest/services/Systems_Planning/Network/FeatureServer/3,"-96.6697,40.3572,-90.0861,43.5411",http://public-iowadot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/08103b01d0414cdd97e9407fe067ed51_3
