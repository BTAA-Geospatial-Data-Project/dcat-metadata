https://data.detroitmi.gov/api/views/esjn-hp3n,Primary Care - Health Professional Shortage Areas,"HRSA develops shortage designation criteria to determine whether a geographic area, population group or facility is a Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) or a Medically Underserved Area/Population (MUA/P). HPSAs may be designated as having a shortage of primary medical care, dental or mental health providers. They may be urban or rural areas, population groups, or medical or other public facilities. MUAs may be a whole county or a group of contiguous counties, a group of counties or civil divisions, or a group of urban census tracts in which residents have a shortage of health services. MUPs may include groups of persons who face economic, cultural or linguistic barriers to health care.",2017-04-11,2017-04-11,https://data.detroitmi.gov/d/esjn-hp3n,https://data.detroitmi.gov/api/views/esjn-hp3n
