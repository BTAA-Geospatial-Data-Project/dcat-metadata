Find more information on?http://imap.maryland.gov.This data set consists of digital data describing sites under the oversight of Maryland Department of the Environment's (MDE) Land Restoration Program (LRP). Within the LRP, two divisions exist to oversee assessment and remediation of potentially contaminated sites.  The State Assessment and Remediation Division includes the Voluntary Cleanup Program (VCP) and CHS Enforcement Sections.  The Federal Assessment and Remediation Division includes the Federal IRP Support Section and NPL/Site Assessment section.  
This dataset describes any VCP applicant or responsible party for the LRP oversight for each site relative to these programs.  This layer is intended for use in concert with the LRP Sites layer.Map Service Link:?http://mdewin64.mde.state.md.us/arcgis/rest/services/MDE_LRP/LandRestorationProgram/MapServer/3",2017-05-08T18:22:57.000Z,2017-06-09T20:11:13.000Z,http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/d08ae47c66a44c04a938eab7a856ac2a_3,http://mdewin64.mde.state.md.us/arcgis/rest/services/MDE_LRP/LandRestorationProgram/MapServer/3,"-79.4542,37.9676,-75.0764,39.7217"

Find more information on?http://imap.maryland.gov.The Rural Legacy Program provides the focus and funding necessary to protect large, contiguous tracts of land and other strategic areas from sprawl development and to enhance natural resource, agricultural, forestry and environmental protection through cooperative efforts among state and local governments and land trusts. Protection is provided through the acquisition of easements and fee estates from willing landowners and the supporting activities of Rural Legacy Sponsors and local governments.This file consists of properties that have been protected using Rural Legacy funds. In the case of a project with multiple parcels, the Identify results will indicate the total acreage and BPW amount for the project.

information at?http://imap.maryland.gov.The storm surge zones data used in this application were generated using the Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model. SLOSH is a computerized model run by the National Weather Service to estimate storm surge heights resulting from historical, hypothetical, or predicted hurricanes. The model creates its estimates by assessing the pressure, size, forward speed, track, and wind data from a storm. Graphical output from the model displays color-coded storm surge heights for a particular area. The calculations are applied to a specific locale's shoreline, incorporating the unique bay and river configurations, water depths, bridges, roads, and other physical features. This file is generated as part of the Hazards Analysis within the Hurricane Evacuation Study for the Maryland Western Shore.Last Updated: 11/2016
