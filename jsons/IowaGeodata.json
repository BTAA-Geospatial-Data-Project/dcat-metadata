Coal was mined in Iowa beginning in the 1840\u0027s and ending in 1994. The mines operated in the southern and central areas of the state using both surface and underground methods.

Approximately 3,000 of these mines can be located to at least one section with about half of those known as points only. The remaining mines leave some information about the area that they operated in. Starting about 1880, the Office of State Mine Inspectors was established to regulate the mining industry to help insure the miners\u2019 safety. One of the requirements enacted at that time was that the mines employing more than four miners would submit detailed mine maps to the State Mine Inspectors every other year.

It has a spatial resolution of one meter, and a class resolution of 15 classes. The target year for the interpretation of the classification is 2009. The Imagery sources are the 2008 NAIP imagery, the 2009 NAIP imagery, and the Four band Spring imagery collected in 2007, 2009 and 2010. Three dates were used because previous experimentation had shown that using fewer dates lacked sufficient spectral information to produce a reasonably consistent classification at the level required. Because each of these imagery layers were collected at widely different dates, to produce consistent classifications required breaking the state into regions or \u0022tiles\u0022 with consistent spectral character. More than 580 such tiles were utilized statewide. Each was independently processed, and separately interpreted and checked. The final products were mosaicked together, then broken out into county files, which is how the files are presented in the NRGIS Library. Although we have done the best job we could to maintain consistency between these many files, it is impossible to maintain absolute consistency in even a small set of files, let alone this large number. The LiDAR data utilized was created by subtracting the Bare Earth DEM from the First Return DEM, yielding a normalized elevation model, which represents the elevation above ground surface of buildings, trees and other vegetation. This layer made an important contribution to producing an accurate classification of buildings and forests. A series of post classification steps were performed to correct problems which were consistent enough to be remedied by this kind of solution. These included embedding rasterized roads, recoding certain shadows, and using the LiDAR to refine building footprints, among others.\u003C\/p\u003E\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","format":"esri rest","accessURL":"https:\/\/programs.iowadnr.gov\/geospatial\/rest\/services\/LandCover\/LC_2009_1m\/MapServer","title":"High Resolution Land Cover of Iowa in 2009 as a Web Service"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","format":"raster","accessURL":"https:\/\/iowageodata.s3.amazonaws.com\/imageryBaseMapsEarthCover\/earthCover\/Land_cover_2009_1m\/HRLC_2009_County_Downloads.html","description":"\u003Cp\u003ECounty dataset in a zipped file.\u003C\/p\u003E\n","title":"High Resolution Land Cover of Iowa in 2009 County Downloads"}],"identifier":"62faee84-5197-482e-91a3-750dfb2cd8aa","issued":"2017-06-08","keyword":["Adams County","Allamakee County","Appanoose County","Audubon County","Benton County","Black Hawk County","Boone County","Bremer County","Buchanan County","Buena Vista County","Butler County","Calhoun County","Carroll County","Cass County","Cedar County","Cerro Gordo County","Cherokee County","Chickasaw County","Clarke County","Clay County","Clayton County","Clinton County","Crawford County","Dallas County","Davis County","Decatur County","Delaware County","Des Moines County","Dickinson County","Dubuque County","Emmet County","Fayette County","Floyd County","Franklin County","Fremont County","Greene County","Grundy County","Guthrie County","Hamilton County","Hancock County","Hardin County","Harrison County","Henry County","Howard County","Humboldt County","Ida County","Iowa County","Jackson County","Jasper County","Jefferson County","Johnson County","Jones County","Keokuk County","Kossuth County","land cover","Lee County","Union County","Van Buren County","Washington County","Warren County","Wapello County","Taylor County","Story County","Tama County","Wright County","Worth County","Woodbury County","Winneshiek County","Winnebago County","Webster County","Wayne County","Sioux County","Shelby County","Montgomery County","Monroe County","Monona County","Mitchell County","Muscatine County","O\u0026#039;Brien County","Mills County","Lucas County","Louisa County","Linn County","Lyon County","Madison County","Marshall County","Marion County","Mahaska County","Osceola County","Ringgold County","Scott County","Sac County","Poweshiek County","Palo Alto County","Page County","Plymouth County","Pottawattamie County","Polk County","Pocahontas County"],"license":"http:\/\/opendefinition.org\/licenses\/cc-zero\/","modified":"2017-06-08","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"geodata.iowa.gov"},"spatial":"POLYGON ((-96.734619140625 40.313043208881, -96.734619140625 43.548548110913, -90.098876953125 43.548548110913, -90.098876953125 40.313043208881))","temporal":"2007-01-01T00:00:00+00:00\/2010-12-31T00:00:00+00:00","title":"High Resolution Land Cover of Iowa in 2009","accessLevel":"public","bureauCode":["000:00"],"programCode":["000:000"]},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"fn":"Kohrt, Casey","hasEmail":"mailto:casey.kohrt@dnr.iowa.gov"},"description":"\u003Cp\u003EThe Public Land Survey System (PLSS) is a way of subdividing and describing land in the United States.

The first shapefile shows areas defined as having moderate scour potential relative to other parts of the floodplain, and the second shows areas defined as having high relative scour potential. The third shapefile shows areas where scour predictions made using this methodology have low confidence and a more detailed study is recommended. These scour predictions are intended to show approximate relative areas of scour potential and are not intended as a replacement for a more detailed 2D or 3D study.
