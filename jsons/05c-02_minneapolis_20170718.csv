The month and year during which this sample was collected. Each sample is collected over a period of 72-hours. The exact dates of collection are not specified on this dataset.Can ID ??A unique identifier for this sample and is determined by concatenating the collecting Summa canister?s identification number with the month and year of collection.Parameter ??The chemical (for this study, all are Volatile Organic Compounds, or VOCs) for which the result is reported.Results ??The amount of the particular VOC (parameter) detected in this sample. All results above the detection limit are reported in this dataset.Units ??The units in which the result is reported. All results are reported in units of micrograms per cubic meter (?g/m3).CAS ??The CAS Registry Number, also referred to as CASRN or CAS Number, is a unique numerical identifier assigned by Chemical Abstracts Service to every chemical substance described in the open scientific literature.HRV ??A Health Risk Value (HRV) is the concentration of a chemical that is likely to pose little or no risk to human health and is being used by our study as a reference level for comparing the results. Most HRVs are expressed as concentrations of micrograms of chemical per cubic meter of air (?g/m3). HRVs are developed to protect human health for a specified length of exposure (e.g., one hour, 13 weeks, a lifetime). In cases where an HRV promulgated using the public process described in the Administrative Procedures Act (Minnesota Statutes Chapter 14) was not available as a reference level, we instead used the recommended exposure limit (REL) from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) or the permissible exposure limit (PEL) from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), selecting the most conservative level. For purposes of our study, all reference levels (HRVs, RELs, and PELs) will be referred to as a Health Risk Value.Units -?The units associated with the HRV, REL, or PEL reference level. All reference levels have been converted to units of micrograms per cubic meter (?g/m3).HRV Types ??The type (HRV, REL, or PEL) of reference level selected. For the purpose of this study, all are referred to as a Health Risk Value. The value selected was the lowest, most conservative value.Name ??The name of the location. Volunteer names and business names are left blank.Description ??The type of location where the canister was placed. Volunteer locations are typically residential sites where the property owner/occupant hosts a sampling Summa canister. Business locations, which are also VOC emitters, who are voluntarily participating in the study. ?MPCA locations are sites of existing Minnesota Pollution Control Agency air monitors sampling for VOCs where a sampling Summa canister is placed for data comparison. MPRB locations are Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board properties. Sponsored locations are sites where the community has paid for additional sampling Summa canisters to be placed.Address ??The address at or near where the sampling Summa canister was placed.City ??For mapping purposes, we have included the city where the sampling Summa canister was placed (all are within the Minneapolis boundary).State ??For mapping purposes, we have included the state where the sampling Summa canister was placed.Zip ??For mapping purposes, we have included the zip code where the sampling Summa canister was placed.",2015-04-27T17:25:16.000Z,2017-06-01T17:31:05.452Z,http://opendata.minneapolismn.gov/datasets/77c3283978464432b9a391b8b9cf7885_0,https://services.arcgis.com/afSMGVsC7QlRK1kZ/arcgis/rest/services/AirQualitySurvey2015Update/FeatureServer/0,"-93.32676124159701,44.89270886631688,-93.208779105617,45.04759052202385",http://opendata.minneapolismn.gov/datasets/77c3283978464432b9a391b8b9cf7885_0

resources provided through the Great Streets Neighborhood Business District
Program. Eligible areas were designated in The Minneapolis Plan for Sustainable
Growth and consist of Activity Centers, Commercial Nodes, Commercial Corridors,
and LRT Station Areas. Exact parcel boundaries of Activity Centers and
Commercial Nodes are identified in The Minneapolis Plan. Commercial Corridor
areas are generally defined as a one block radius from designated corridors.
LRT Station Areas are defined as a ? mile radius from each LRT station outside
of downtown. Some staff discretion was used in determining precise boundaries
for Commercial Corridors and LRT Station Areas in cases where roadways or other
natural boundaries made exact definitions unclear.

?

Each area is categorized based on a number of metrics used
to determine its economic health and opportunity. Varying levels of Great
Streets program resources are available, based on this categorization. These
categories are defined as:

?

Intervene: Areas that are experiencing weak development
interest or significant obstacles to attaining the City?s commercial
development or business investment goals.

Support: Areas showing signs of strength, but that remain
fragile and have some barriers to market development and business investment.

Monitor: Areas with strong market development and business
activity.

http://opendata.minneapolismn.gov/datasets/14f8335c52304a2ca09c4e88ae549eb9_0,Minneapolis Energy Benchmarking Results from 2012-2015,"Properties are organized by the category in which they were phased in to the benchmarking program, with important metrics from the most recent reporting year of 2015 being toggleable.  By clicking on a point, a user may learn more about an individual property's characteristics, energy efficiency, and water use from prior reporting years when available. Public buildings from the City of Minneapolis, Hennepin County, the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board, and Minneapolis Public Schools were phased in first and therefore show data for 2012-2015.  The largest private buildings 100,000 sqft and greater, show publicly available data starting in 2014.  The remaining category, private buildings between 50,000-100,000 sqft in size, data is made publicly available starting with the 2015 dataset.  

The toggleable metrics highlight the most summary information of building energy and water efficiency:

ENERGY STAR score - The 1-100 ENERGY STAR score was developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and provides a metric for comparison with other similar buildings across the country.  The score accounts for differences in climate, occupancy and operating hours.  A score of 50 represents median energy performance, while a score of 75 or better indicates a building is a top performer.  The higher the score, the more efficient the building. 

Energy Use Intensity (EUI) - The metric used for comparing buildings in Energy Star, EUI expresses a building?s energy use relative to its size. In this report it is expressed as kBtu/ft?, and is calculated by taking the total energy consumed in a year (in kBtu) and dividing it by the floor area of the building (in ft?).  The lower the kBtu/ft?, the lower the energy consumption.

Weather-normalized Energy Use Intensity - Energy use is adjusted to account year-to-year weather differences, allowing for comparison of a building to itself over time. Through this procedure, the energy in a given year is adjusted to express the energy that would have been consumed under 30-year average weather conditions.  Weather-normalized EUI also uses the kBtu/ft? unit.
