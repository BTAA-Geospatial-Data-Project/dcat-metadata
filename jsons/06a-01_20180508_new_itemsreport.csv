State of Michigan,"[u'2011', u'Trout', u'Salmon', u'Lakes', u'Michigan', u'Fishing regulations']",http://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/db449536e232482d913dfd7d15e26cfc_2,Brook Trout Restoration Area Line,"Features from the 1:24,000 scale National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) were used to depict the 2016-2018 Michigan trout and salmon inland stream regulations. NHD features were altered to fit the extent of the regulations described in FO 200.16 and FO 210.16. Every inland stream reach in this package has a regulation type (or multiple regulation types) and a designation status. The regulation type is indicated in the Reg_Type field and the designation status is indicated in the Designated field (with 0 as non-designated and 1 as designated) Each regulation type is associated with specific rules for the length of the fishing and possession seasons, minimum size limits, and daily possession limits. See FO 200.16 and the Michigan Fishing Guide for more details about the individual regulation types.Regulation types are as follows:1 - Type 1 Trout Stream2 - Type 2 Trout Stream3 - Type 3 Trout Stream4 - Type 4 Trout StreamBTRA ? Brook Trout Restoration AreaRA - Research Area Trout StreamGR - Gear Restricted StreamDesignation status is either designated or non-designated. Designated trout streams are inland streams containing a significant population of trout or salmon, as identified by the State of Michigan. Designated trout streams are protected from certain activities, see the Michigan Fishing Guide or FO 210.16 for more details. All Type 1, Type 2, GR, and BTRA are designated trout streams. Most Type 3 and Type 4 streams are designated trout streams. Most inland salmon and trout stream regulations are depicted in the main trout and salmon stream regulations layer (mi_trout_and_salmon_stream_fishing_regulations_main_2016_to_2018). Streams with multiple regulations will have additional features in the BTRA (mi_trout_and_salmon_stream_fishing_regulations_btra_lines_2016_to_2018 and mi_trout_and_salmon_stream_fishing_regulations_btra_portage_2016_to_2018) or the dual regulation layers (mi_trout_and_salmon_stream_fishing_regulations_dual_regs_2016_to_2018). All four layers must be displayed in the proper order using the established symbology to show the trout and salmon inland stream regulations for the state. The BTRA Portage polygon layer should be displayed on the top of the other layers, with the dual regulations underneath the BTRA Portage layer, the main file underneath the dual regulations, and finally the BTRA lines on the bottom.
