TO DOWNLOAD THIS DATA BY COUNTY WITH LITHOLOGY FILE CLICK HERE.The data in these six files is derived from Wellogic, the
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality statewide ground water database. The six files combined contain information on over
575,000 spatially verified water well records.?
The six files are intended to provide water well information for wells
in counties clustered by geographic region: Upper Peninsula, Northern Lower
Peninsula, East Central Lower Peninsula, West Central Lower Peninsula,
Southwest Lower Peninsula and the South Central ? Southeastern Lower Peninsula. The files are constructed to be easily
merged, containing the same number and type of attribute fields.

Although the derived data in these files represents the
best readily available data, the six files do not represent a complete database
of all wells or well records in existence. ?Until January 1, 2000 not all water well
records for new wells in Michigan were entered into Wellogic. For wells drilled before 2000 the rate of
inclusion is highly variable from one county to another. Further, there is a quality control check on
location that may exclude a limited number of wells from Wellogic from the six
files made available on this site.More Metadata",2015-10-16T15:17:08.000Z,2017-12-18T17:19:34.348Z,http://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/5302277c5b544981a645bfd9929d9709_4,https://gisago.mcgi.state.mi.us/arcgis/rest/services/OpenData/public_health/MapServer/4,"-90.4077,41.656,-82.4156,48.1419",http://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/5302277c5b544981a645bfd9929d9709_4

The
Michigan Carpool Parking Lot Program (sometimes referred to as Park and Ride)
began as a pilot program in 1974 with 11 carpool parking lots. Today there are
over 240 carpool parking lots located across the state providing nearly 9,000
parking spaces. In addition to lots owned and maintained by MDOT, the Meijer
Corporation has partnered with MDOT to provide carpool parking at several of
their stores. Please see the?MDOT Metadata Form?for additional information.

Update
Cycle:?Carpool
lots are added and updated as needed when new lots are constructed or removed.

Coverage: This inventory shows all
MDOT owned and operated carpool lots in Michigan along with several Meijer
parking lots that provide carpool parking in partnership with MDOT.

TO DOWNLOAD THIS DATA BY COUNTY WITH LITHOLOGY FILE?CLICK HERE.The data in these six files is derived from Wellogic, the
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality statewide ground water database. ?The six files combined contain information on over
575,000 spatially verified water well records.?
The six files are intended to provide water well information for wells
in counties clustered by geographic region: Upper Peninsula, Northern Lower
Peninsula, East Central Lower Peninsula, West Central Lower Peninsula,
Southwest Lower Peninsula and the South Central ? Southeastern Lower Peninsula.? The files are constructed to be easily
merged, containing the same number and type of attribute fields.

Although the derived data in these files represents the
best readily available data, the six files do not represent a complete database
of all wells or well records in existence. ?Until January 1, 2000 not all water well
records for new wells in Michigan were entered into Wellogic.? For wells drilled before 2000 the rate of
inclusion is highly variable from one county to another.? Further, there is a quality control check on
location that may exclude a limited number of wells from Wellogic from the six
files made available on this site.More Metadata",2015-10-19T13:16:13.000Z,2017-07-28T21:08:56.000Z,http://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/5c1f42d9514c4ba38c29b50a5dfbd9a4_9,https://gisago.mcgi.state.mi.us/arcgis/rest/services/OpenData/public_health/MapServer/9,"-90.4077,41.656,-82.4156,48.1419",http://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/5c1f42d9514c4ba38c29b50a5dfbd9a4_9
