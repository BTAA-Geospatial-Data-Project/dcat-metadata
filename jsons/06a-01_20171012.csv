Michigan Department of Environmental Quality statewide ground water database. ?The six files combined contain information on over

Southwest Lower Peninsula and the South Central ? Southeastern Lower Peninsula.? The files are constructed to be easily
merged, containing the same number and type of attribute fields.

of all wells or well records in existence. ?Until January 1, 2000 not all water well
records for new wells in Michigan were entered into Wellogic.? For wells drilled before 2000 the rate of
inclusion is highly variable from one county to another.? Further, there is a quality control check on

check rules for specific rules, regulations, and restrictions as they relate to
what equipment might be used, before using such equipment, as not all equipment
legal on public places, residential or commercial buildings, or such are

?

Accessible
features on State Wildlife/Game Area include those which have low-slope, no
stairs or steps along features, and are accessible for wheelchairs, or personal
assistive mobility devices (PAMDs).? All
buildings, DNR Shooting-Ranges, and other permanent public use structures are
fully ADA compliant and accessible.? It
is the more natural features being identified in this layer.? Many of these features are fully ADA code
compliant (which is ~1 inch rise or less over 12 inch distances) and are
regularly checked for obstructions, while other features comply with the
low-slope requirements or are identified as such so they are not over-represented
to a lower or no slope level.? In natural
rustic areas it can be difficult to maintain these slope limits and to clearing
check for naturally-occurring obstructions like leaves, sticks or other
naturally occurring items which blow or wash onto trails or outside features.? Therefore, features are frequently identified
as no-slope or low-slope/PAMD levels and not over-represented as fully ADA
compliant.? 

?

The
DNR Wildlife Division is in a updated state-wide review to identify features
and provide better information on accessible features, such as by GIS
compatible layers provided here.? Accessible
features typically include accessible combinations of parking, a trail and a
destination location like a platform or blind location; read the attribute
fields like the ?comment? field, for details on what is at the provided data
point, line or polygon.? Although
available for use by anyone, it's hoped consideration for use will be given to
those individuals that have limited mobility, please, for use of these accessible
parking, trails, blinds or platforms, and other features.? Patience is appreciated for local site
conditions which might be caused by weather, wind or rain, wildlife or other
public users; please report any problems with features to either the local DNR
Wildlife office or the main DNR Wildlife help options (e-mail DNR-Wildlife@michigan.gov , or call 517-284-9453).",2016-10-27T15:25:26.000Z,2017-10-11T16:46:42.000Z,http://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/bbd38e254c3a40a498678a1f59c38f72_9,https://gisago.mcgi.state.mi.us/arcgis/rest/services/DNR/dnrWildlife/MapServer/9,"-88.4629,42.3897,-83.9603,47.1726",http://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/bbd38e254c3a40a498678a1f59c38f72_9

These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979). Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands. These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery. By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of farmed wetlands as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition.

began as a pilot program in 1974 with 11 carpool parking lots. Today there are
over 240 carpool parking lots located across the state providing nearly 9,000
parking spaces. In addition to lots owned and maintained by MDOT, the Meijer
Corporation has partnered with MDOT to provide carpool parking at several of
their stores. Please see the?MDOT Metadata Form?for additional information.

Update
Cycle:?Carpool
lots are added and updated as needed when new lots are constructed or removed.

Coverage: This inventory shows all
MDOT owned and operated carpool lots in Michigan along with several Meijer
parking lots that provide carpool parking in partnership with MDOT.

These are?the statistical counterparts of incorporated places, and are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the state in which they are located. The boundaries usually are defined in cooperation with local or tribal officials and generally updated prior to each decennial census. These boundaries, which usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity boundary, have no legal status, nor do these places have officials elected to serve traditional municipal functions. CDP boundaries may change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary. CDPs must be contained within a single state and may not extend into an incorporated place. There are no population size requirements for CDPs.More Metadata",2015-02-27T21:37:54.000Z,2017-08-28T16:42:25.000Z,http://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/2e7d9b6b3f2c435baba8492eca5b5a01_4,https://gisago.mcgi.state.mi.us/arcgis/rest/services/OpenData/michigan_geographic_framework/MapServer/4,"-88.4579,41.7008,-82.2626,47.2141",http://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/2e7d9b6b3f2c435baba8492eca5b5a01_4

The baseflow of a stream or river is the amount of groundwater discharged from an aquifer to the watercourse. This discharge occurs year-round, and fluctuates seasonally depending on the level of the water in the aquifer. Baseflow is supplemented by direct runoff during and immediately after precipitation or melt events, resulting in peaks on a hydrograph showing stream flow through time. The process of dividing these peaks into base flow and runoff is called hydrograph separation. Hydrograph separations were completed for all USGS stream- flow gaging stations in Michigan that had more than 10 years of daily records. Sites that were clearly affected by upstream impoundments (lakes, dams) were excluded. No attempt was made to detect or correct for trends in the data. This may lead to some errors in the comparison of streams with data from different time periods if there is an underlying temporal trend in the data, but inclusion of all records in the analysis was necessary to increase the data pool and provide better spatial coverage. Watersheds were delineated for each of the 208 stream-flow gaging stations, and various characteristics of each watershed, such as topographic relief, surficial geology, land cover, growing degree days, annual and winter-season precipitation, and others were tabulated.

http://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/1c9b201348d14654a3e011c7db3076de_3,Base Flow of Michigan Streams,"This data set provides estimates of the ground-water contribution to stream flow, frequently referred to as base flow, in cubic feet per second. The baseflow of a stream or river is the amount of groundwater discharged from an aquifer to the watercourse. This discharge occurs year-round, and fluctuates seasonally depending on the level of the water in the aquifer. Baseflow is supplemented by direct runoff during and immediately after precipitation or melt events, resulting in peaks on a hydrograph showing stream flow through time. The process of dividing these peaks into base flow and runoff is called hydrograph separation. Hydrograph separations were completed for all USGS stream- flow gaging stations in Michigan that had more than 10 years of daily records. Sites that were clearly affected by upstream impoundments (lakes, dams) were excluded. No attempt was made to detect or correct for trends in the data. This may lead to some errors in the comparison of streams with data from different time periods if there is an underlying temporal trend in the data, but inclusion of all records in the analysis was necessary to increase the data pool and provide better spatial coverage. Watersheds were delineated for each of the 208 stream-flow gaging stations, and various characteristics of each watershed, such as topographic relief, surficial geology, land cover, growing degree days, annual and winter-season precipitation, and others were tabulated. Regression modeling, described in the Technical Report, was used to estimate the baseflow for each steam segment of the 1:100,000-scale National Hydrography Dataset.",2017-04-27T12:21:24.000Z,2017-09-15T13:25:49.311Z,http://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/1c9b201348d14654a3e011c7db3076de_3,https://gisago.mcgi.state.mi.us/arcgis/rest/services/OpenData/hydro/MapServer/3,"-90.3951,41.2769,-82.4174,47.4692",http://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/1c9b201348d14654a3e011c7db3076de_3

TO DOWNLOAD THIS DATA BY COUNTY WITH LITHOLOGY FILE?CLICK HERE.The data in these six files is derived from Wellogic, the
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality statewide ground water database. ?The six files combined contain information on over
575,000 spatially verified water well records.?
The six files are intended to provide water well information for wells
in counties clustered by geographic region: Upper Peninsula, Northern Lower
Peninsula, East Central Lower Peninsula, West Central Lower Peninsula,
Southwest Lower Peninsula and the South Central ? Southeastern Lower Peninsula.? The files are constructed to be easily
merged, containing the same number and type of attribute fields.

Although the derived data in these files represents the
best readily available data, the six files do not represent a complete database
of all wells or well records in existence. ?Until January 1, 2000 not all water well
records for new wells in Michigan were entered into Wellogic.? For wells drilled before 2000 the rate of
inclusion is highly variable from one county to another.? Further, there is a quality control check on
location that may exclude a limited number of wells from Wellogic from the six
files made available on this site.More Metadata",2015-10-19T12:32:30.000Z,2017-07-28T21:06:00.000Z,http://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/f3d340db7938420d89d6460c00c41e9e_8,https://gisago.mcgi.state.mi.us/arcgis/rest/services/OpenData/public_health/MapServer/8,"-90.4077,41.656,-82.4156,48.1419",http://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/f3d340db7938420d89d6460c00c41e9e_8

TO DOWNLOAD THIS DATA BY COUNTY WITH LITHOLOGY FILE?CLICK HERE.The data in these six files is derived from Wellogic, the
Michigan Department of Environmental Quality statewide ground water database. ?The six files combined contain information on over
575,000 spatially verified water well records.?
The six files are intended to provide water well information for wells
in counties clustered by geographic region: Upper Peninsula, Northern Lower
Peninsula, East Central Lower Peninsula, West Central Lower Peninsula,
Southwest Lower Peninsula and the South Central ? Southeastern Lower Peninsula.? The files are constructed to be easily
merged, containing the same number and type of attribute fields.

Although the derived data in these files represents the
best readily available data, the six files do not represent a complete database
of all wells or well records in existence. ?Until January 1, 2000 not all water well
records for new wells in Michigan were entered into Wellogic.? For wells drilled before 2000 the rate of
inclusion is highly variable from one county to another.? Further, there is a quality control check on
location that may exclude a limited number of wells from Wellogic from the six
files made available on this site.More Metadata",2015-10-16T19:11:22.000Z,2017-07-28T21:11:57.000Z,http://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/7711ba3d99ee4bf1b967812da2e0e21b_6,https://gisago.mcgi.state.mi.us/arcgis/rest/services/OpenData/public_health/MapServer/6,"-90.4077,41.656,-82.4156,48.1419",http://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/7711ba3d99ee4bf1b967812da2e0e21b_6
