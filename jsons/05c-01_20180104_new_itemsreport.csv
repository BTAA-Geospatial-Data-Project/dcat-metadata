Rental Property

Minneapolis requires that every rental dwelling, including
single-family rental dwellings and rental units in owner-occupied duplexes, and
rooming and shared-bath units (unless they are in a licensed lodging house)
must have a rental license.?The
number of locations shown on the map above reflects the unique amount of
dwellings in the City of Minneapolis with rental licenses, not the unique
amount of rental licenses.

Why License Rental
Properties?

The intent of the rental license ordinance is to:


 Promote the health, safety, and
     welfare of the general public.
 Assure preservation of the
     existing housing supply.
 Help maintain property values.
 Work toward eliminating
     substandard and deteriorating rental housing.
 Maintain a living environment
     that contributes to healthful individual and family living.


For more information on the licensing process, call 311 or outside
Minneapolis city limits call (612) 673-3000.

Note: All owner and applicant information is provided from
the rental license application submitted by the applicant.
