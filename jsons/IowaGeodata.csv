The contours were developed using elevation data from the state of Iowa's LiDAR program.  The original 1 meter lidar grids were generalized to 3 meter resolution, and the contouring program applied with a 2 foot interval processed 10 feet at a time, so the program would have enough memory to complete.  Contour lines were simplified using a 2 foot tolerance, and lines less than 100 ft in length were discarded.  Ten foot index contours are identified in the attribute table.  Contours crossing water features sometimes have a triangular appearance due to lack of lidar returns over water and should be ignored.

90eda41a-d8f6-47d1-ab36-e4bdf80a2bb1,Animal Feeding Operations,"Iowa has two types of DNR-regulated animal feeding operations (AFOs): confinements and open feedlots. Both AFO types are confined (kept and fed for 45 days or more per year) in a lot, yard, corral, building or other area. Both types include manure storage structures, but do not include livestock markets.
confinement feeding operation:
A confinement feeding operation (above) confines animals to areas that are totally roofed. Confinement feeding operations in Iowa must retain all manure.
open feedlot:
An open feedlot is unroofed or partially roofed with no vegetation or residue ground cover while the animals are confined. Large open feedlots with a national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit are allowed to discharge to a water of the state under certain conditions listed in the permit, such as during a storm event larger than the 25-year, 24-hour storm.
A combined operation has some animals in a confinement and some in an open feedlot.

The primary intent is to provide information to evaluate potential impacts to the land surface from the historic coal mines, although the data may also be useful for historical and scientific research. Coal was mined in Iowa beginning in the 1840's and ending in 1994. The mines operated in the southern and central areas of the state using both surface and underground methods. Based on available records, it is estimated that over 6,000 individual mines may have operated in Iowa during the state?s 150 year mining history. Approximately 3,000 of these mines can be located to at least one section with about half of those known as points only. The remaining mines leave some information about the area that they operated in. Starting about 1880, the Office of State Mine Inspectors was established to regulate the mining industry to help insure the miners? safety. One of the requirements enacted at that time was that the mines employing more than four miners would submit detailed mine maps to the State Mine Inspectors every other year. Many of the mines that were exempt from this requirement were very small, local mines that operated to supply a few households. A large number of these mines may not be represented in this dataset.

The Iowa Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) Project collects location and elevation (X, Y, Z) data to a set standard for the entire state of Iowa.
LIDAR is defined as an airborne laser system, flown aboard rotary or fixed-wing aircraft, that is used to acquire x, y, and z coordinates of terrain and terrain features that are both manmade and naturally occurring. LIDAR systems consist of a light-emitting scanning laser, an airborne Global Positioning System (GPS) with attendant GPS base station(s), and an Inertial Measuring Unit (IMU).
The laser scanning system measures ranges from the scanning laser to terrain surfaces by measuring the time it takes for the emitted light (LIDAR return) to reach the earth's surface and reflect back to the onboard LIDAR detector.
The airborne GPS system ascertains the in-flight three-dimensional position of the sensor, and the IMU delivers precise information about the attitude of the sensor. The LIDAR system incorporates data from these three subsystems to produce a large cloud of points on the land surface whose X, Y, and Z coordinates are known within the specified accuracy.
This collection consists of ASCII files of bare earth elevations and intensity (x,y,z,i) and, LAS (version 1.0 lidar data interchange standard) binary files that include all 1st and last returns, intensity and bare earth classification.

62faee84-5197-482e-91a3-750dfb2cd8aa,High Resolution Land Cover of Iowa in 2009,"This High Resolution Landcover product was derived from three dates of aerial imagery, and from elevation information derived from LiDAR elevation data. It has a spatial resolution of one meter, and a class resolution of 15 classes. The target year for the interpretation of the classification is 2009. The Imagery sources are the 2008 NAIP imagery, the 2009 NAIP imagery, and the Four band Spring imagery collected in 2007, 2009 and 2010. Three dates were used because previous experimentation had shown that using fewer dates lacked sufficient spectral information to produce a reasonably consistent classification at the level required. Because each of these imagery layers were collected at widely different dates, to produce consistent classifications required breaking the state into regions or ""tiles"" with consistent spectral character. More than 580 such tiles were utilized statewide. Each was independently processed, and separately interpreted and checked. The final products were mosaicked together, then broken out into county files, which is how the files are presented in the NRGIS Library. Although we have done the best job we could to maintain consistency between these many files, it is impossible to maintain absolute consistency in even a small set of files, let alone this large number. The LiDAR data utilized was created by subtracting the Bare Earth DEM from the First Return DEM, yielding a normalized elevation model, which represents the elevation above ground surface of buildings, trees and other vegetation. This layer made an important contribution to producing an accurate classification of buildings and forests. A series of post classification steps were performed to correct problems which were consistent enough to be remedied by this kind of solution. These included embedding rasterized roads, recoding certain shadows, and using the LiDAR to refine building footprints, among others.
