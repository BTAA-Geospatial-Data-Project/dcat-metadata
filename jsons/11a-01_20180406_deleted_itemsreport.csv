The remaining portion of this abstract, as well as much of the remaining metadata, references the entire Places of Worship database from which this subset was derived: The Places of Worship dataset is composed of any type of building or portion of a building that is used, constructed, designed, or adapted to be used as a place for religious and spiritual activities. These facilities include, but are not limited to, the following types: chapels, churches, mosques, shrines, synagogues, and temples. The license free Large Protestant Churches, Mosques, Jewish Synagogues, and Roman Catholic Churches in Large Cities datasets were merged together to create the initial data for the Places of Worship dataset. Additional entities have been added from TGS research. This dataset contains Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Islamic, Judaic, and Sikh places of worship. Unitarian places of worship have been included when a congregation from one of these religions meets at a church owned by a Unitarian congregation. Some Protestant denominations are not currently represented in this dataset. The Places of Worship dataset is not intended to include homes of religious leaders (unless they also serve as a place of organized worship), religious schools (unless they also serve as a place of organized worship for people other than those enrolled in the school), Jewish Mikvahs or Hillel facilities, and buildings that serve a purely administrative purpose. If a building's primary purpose is something other than worship (e.g., a community center, a public school), but a religious group uses the building for worship on a regular basis, it was included in this dataset if it otherwise met the criteria for inclusion. Convents and monasteries are included in this dataset, regardless of whether or not the facilities are open to the public, because religious services are regularly held at these locations. TGS was not tasked with ensuring the completeness of this layer. No entities are included in this dataset for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. On 08/07/2007, TGS ceased making phone calls to verify information about religious locations. Therefore, most entities in this dataset were verified using alternative reference sources such as topographic maps, parcel maps, various sources of imagery, and internet research.

A local health department may be locally governed, part of a region or district, be an office or an administrative unit of the state health department, or a hybrid of these. Furthermore, each community has a unique public health system comprising individuals and public and private entities that are engaged in activities that affect the public's health. (Excerpted from the Operational Definition of a functional local health department, National Association of County and City Health Officials, November 2005) Please reference http://www.naccho.org/topics/infrastructure/accreditation/upload/OperationalDefinitionBrochure-2.pdf for more information. Facilities involved in direct patient care are intended to be excluded from this dataset; however, some of the entities represented in this dataset serve as both administrative and clinical locations. This dataset only includes the headquarters of Public Health Departments, not their satellite offices. Some health departments encompass multiple counties; therefore, not every county will be represented by an individual record. Also, some areas will appear to have over representation depending on the structure of the health departments in that particular region. Town health officers are included in Vermont and boards of health are included in Massachusetts. Both of these types of entities are elected or appointed to a term of office during which they make and enforce policies and regulations related to the protection of public health. Visiting nurses are represented in this dataset if they are contracted through the local government to fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the local health organization. Since many town health officers in Vermont work out of their personal homes, TechniGraphics represented these entities at the town hall. This is denoted in the [DIRECTIONS] field.

The EMS stations dataset consists of any location where emergency medical service (EMS) personnel are stationed or based out of, or where equipment that such personnel use in carrying out their jobs is stored for ready use. Ambulance services are included even if they only provide transportation services, but not if they are located at, and operated by, a hospital. If an independent ambulance service or EMS provider happens to be collocated with a hospital, it will be included in this dataset. The dataset includes both private and governmental entities. TGS has made a concerted effort to include all emergency medical service locations in the United States and its territories. This dataset is comprised completely of license free data. The HSIP Freedom Fire Station dataset and the HSIP Freedom EMS dataset were merged into one working file. TGS processed as one file and then separated for delivery purposes.

(Source: Urgent Care Association of America) The Urgent Care dataset consists of any location that is capable of providing emergency medical care and must provide emergency medical treatment beyond what can normally be provided by an EMS unit, must be able to perform surgery, or must be able to provide recuperative care beyond what is normally provided by a doctor's office. In times of emergency, the facility must be able to accept patients from the general population or patients from a significant subset of the general population (e.g., children). Florida and Arizona license Urgent Care facilities within their state. However, the criteria for licensing and the criteria for inclusion in this dataset do not appear to be the same. For these two states, this dataset contains entities that fit TGS' criteria for an Urgent Care facility but may not be licensed as Urgent Care by the state. During processing, TGS found that this is a rapidly changing industry. Although TGS intended for all Urgent Care facilities to be included in this dataset, the newest facilities may not be included. Entities that are excluded from this dataset are administrative offices, physician offices, workman compensation facilities, free standing emergency rooms, and hospitals. Urgent Care facilities that are operated by and co-located with a hospital are also excluded because the locations are included in the hospital dataset.

A hurricane evacuation route is a designated route used to direct traffic inland in case of a hurricane threat. This dataset is based on supplied data from Gulf Coast and Atlantic Seaboard states. Each state was contacted by TGS to determine an official source for hurricane evacuation routes. GIS data was gathered from states willing to share such data. In cases where states were unable or unwilling to share data in this format, TGS requested that the states provide a source for identifying hurricane evacuation routes. The states usually identified a website that made this data available to the public. Three (3) states (ME, NY, and NH) indicated that they do not maintain public maps showing hurricane evacuation routes and were unable or unwilling to share GIS files depicting such routes. Hurricane evacuation routes depicted on non-GIS maps were digitized using aerial ortho imagery while referencing supplied maps. Shape files that depicted hurricane evacuation routes were edge matched and merged with the digitized evacuation routes. All routes identified as primary hurricane evacuation routes were included in this dataset. If a state also designated secondary hurricane evacuation routes, they were included as well.

http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/f1607dc637274849bd468d094b31881e_0,PSAP 911 Service Area Boundaries,"911 Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) service area boundaries in the United States According to the National Emergency Number Association (NENA), a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) is a facility equipped and staffed to receive 9-1-1 calls. The service area is the geographic area within which a 911 call placed using a landline is answered at the associated PSAP. This dataset only includes primary PSAPs. Secondary PSAPs, backup PSAPs, and wireless PSAPs have been excluded from this dataset. Primary PSAPs receive calls directly, whereas secondary PSAPs receive calls that have been transferred by a primary PSAP. Backup PSAPs provide service in cases where another PSAP is inoperable. Most military bases have their own emergency telephone systems. To connect to such a system from within a military base, it may be necessary to dial a number other than 9 1 1. Due to the sensitive nature of military installations, TGS did not actively research these systems. If civilian authorities in surrounding areas volunteered information about these systems, or if adding a military PSAP was necessary to fill a hole in civilian provided data, TGS included it in this dataset. Otherwise, military installations are depicted as being covered by one or more adjoining civilian emergency telephone systems. In some cases, areas are covered by more than one PSAP boundary. In these cases, any of the applicable PSAPs may take a 911 call. Where a specific call is routed may depend on how busy the applicable PSAPs are (i.e., load balancing), operational status (i.e., redundancy), or time of day / day of week. If an area does not have 911 service, TGS included that area in the dataset along with the address and phone number of their dispatch center. These are areas where someone must dial a 7 or 10 digit number to get emergency services. These records can be identified by a Y in the [NON911EMNO] field. This indicates that dialing 911 inside one of these areas does not connect one with emergency services. This dataset was constructed by gathering information about PSAPs from state level officials. In some cases, this was geospatial information; in other cases, it was tabular. This information was supplemented with a list of PSAPs from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Each PSAP was researched to verify its tabular information. In cases where the source data was not geospatial, each PSAP was researched to determine its service area in terms of existing boundaries (e.g., city and county boundaries). In some cases, existing boundaries had to be modified to reflect coverage areas (e.g., entire county north of Country Road 30). However, there may be cases where minor deviations from existing boundaries are not reflected in this dataset, such as the case where a particular PSAPs coverage area includes an entire county plus the homes and businesses along a road which is partly in another county.

It should not include planned and suspended (non-operational) sites and mobile clinics. These definitions were set by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Policy Board in December 1998 and are the basis for defining the category and the additional service types for each VHA service site. These definitions cover sites generally owned by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) with the exception of leased and contracted community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs). 1. VA HOSPITAL: an institution (health care site) that is owned, staffed and operated by VA and whose primary function is to provide inpatient services. NOTE: Each geographically unique inpatient division of an integrated facility is counted as a separate hospital. 2. VA RESIDENTIAL REHABILITATION TREATMENT PROGRAM (RRTP): provides comprehensive health and social services in a VA facility for eligible veterans who are ambulatory and do not require the level of care provided in nursing homes. 3. VA NURSING HOME CARE UNITS (NHCU): provides care to individuals who are not in need of hospital care, but who require nursing care and related medical or psychosocial services in an institutional setting. VA NHCUs are facilities designed to care for patients who require a comprehensive care management system coordinated by an interdisciplinary team. Services provided include nursing, medical, rehabilitative, recreational, dietetic, psychosocial, pharmaceutical, radiological, laboratory, dental and spiritual. 4. VA OUTPATIENT CLINICS: a. Community-Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC): a VA-operated, VA-funded, or VA-reimbursed health care facility or site geographically distinct or separate from a parent medical facility. This term encompasses all types of VA outpatient clinics, except hospital-based, independent and mobile clinics. Satellite, community-based, and outreach clinics have been redefined as CBOCs. Technically, CBOCs fall into four Categories, which are:  (i) VA-owned. A CBOC that is owned and staffed by VA.  (ii) Leased. A CBOC where the space is leased (contracted), but is staffed by VA. NOTE: This includes donated space staffed by VA.  (iii) Contracted. A CBOC where the space and the staff are not VA. This is typically a Healthcare Management Organization (HMO)-type provided where multiple sites can be associated with a single station identifier.  (iv) Not Operational. A CBOC which has been approved by Congress, but has not yet begun operating. b. Hospital-Based Outpatient Clinic: outpatient clinic functions located at a hospital. c. Independent Outpatient Clinic: a full-time, self-contained, freestanding, ambulatory care clinic that has no management, program, or fiscal relationship to a VA medical facility. Primary and specialty health care services are provided in an outpatient setting. 5. VET CENTER: Provides professional readjustment counseling, community education, outreach to special populations, brokering of services with community agencies, and access to links between the veteran and VA. 6. VA MEDICAL CENTER (VAMC): a medical center is a unique VA site of care providing two or more types of services that reside at a single physical site location. The services provided are the primary service as tracked in the VHA Site Tracking (VAST) (i.e., VA Hospital, Nursing Home, Domiciliary, independent outpatient clinic (IOC), hospital-based outpatient clinic (HBOC), and CBOC).

No data could be obtained for Consolidated Freightways, Ryder Integrated Logistics, RPS and J.B. Hunt Transport Services. Facilities associated with these companies are not included in this dataset even though these companies have more annual revenue that some of the companies that are represented in this dataset. Many smaller, but still significant, companies have been excluded due to resource constraints. Examples include United Van Lines, Overnite Transportation, and American Freightways. Rail, air, sea, pipeline and inter-modal terminals are not included unless they are operated by one of the companies represented in this dataset. Facilities associated with the United States Postal Service (USPS) are not included. This dataset does not include retail shipping stores, drop boxes, and transportation operations that are not operated for hire. No entities located in American Samoa, The Northern Mariana Islands or the Virgin Islands are included in this dataset. The companies represented in this dataset are involved in the parcel delivery / courier service business or the freight service provider business. Parcel delivery / courier services deliver parcels, packages and other small shipments that typically weight less than 100 pounds according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. A freight service provider can include motor carriers, for-hire carriers and freight forwarders. According to the United Shippers Corporation, a motor carrier is defined as a company that provides truck transportation. A for-hire carrier is defined as a company that provides truck transportation of cargo belonging to others and is paid for doing so. A freight forwarder is defined as a company that arranges for truck transportation of cargo belonging to others, utilizing for-hire carriers to provide the actual truck transportation. The forwarder does assume the responsibility for the cargo from origin to destination and usually does take possession of the cargo at some point during the transportation. Forwarders typically assemble and consolidate less-than-truckload shipments into truckload shipments at origin and disassemble and deliver less-than-truckload shipments at destination. The intention of TGS is to include only those entities that meet the above definition. TGS was not able to contact all of the entities in this layer to verify that they met this definition, therefore some entities may be included in this layer that do not meet the definition.

Emergency Operations Centers may be organized by major functional disciplines (e.g., fire, law enforcement, and medical services), by jurisdiction (e.g., Federal, State, regional, county, city, tribal), or some combination thereof. (Excerpted from the National Incident Management System) The GFI source for this layer contains State and Federal Emergency Operations Centers in addition to local Emergency Operations Centers. This dataset contains these features as well. In cases where an Emergency Operations Center has a mobile unit, TechniGraphics captured the location of the mobile unit as a separate record. This record represents where the mobile unit is stored. If this location could not be verified, a point was placed in the approximate center of the Emergency Operations Centers service area. Effort was made by TechniGraphics to verify whether or not each Emergency Operations Center has a generator on-site and whether or not the Emergency Operations Center is located in a basement. This information is indicated by the values in the [GENERATOR] and [BASEMENT] fields respectively. In cases where more than one record existed for a geographical area (e.g., county, city), TechniGraphics verified whether or not one of the records represented an alternate location. This was indicated by appending -ALTERNATE to the value in the [NAME] field. Some Emergency Operations Centers are located at private residences. The [TYPE] field was manually evaluated during the delivery process to compare the records in which the [NAME] field contained -ALTERNATE. In cases where these values contradicted information that was verified by TechniGraphics (e.g. [NAME] contained -ALTERNATE and [TYPE] = PRIMARY), the value in the [TYPE] field was changed to match the type indicated by the [NAME] of the verified record. TechniGraphics did not change values in this field if the type was not verified. Records with -DOD appended to the end of the [NAME] value are located on a military base, as defined by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) military installations and military range boundaries. # and * characters were automatically removed from standard HSIP fields that TechniGraphics populated.

http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/ece7900854a443c28e1351a2eb3d7e7c_0,All Places of Worship,"Places of Worship in the United States. The Places of Worship dataset is composed of any type of building or portion of a building that is used, constructed, designed, or adapted to be used as a place for religious and spiritual activities. These facilities include, but are not limited to, the following types: chapels, churches, mosques, shrines, synagogues, and temples. The license free Large Protestant Churches, Mosques, Jewish Synagogues, and Roman Catholic Churches in Large Cities datasets were merged together to create the initial data for the Places of Worship dataset. Additional entities have been added from TGS research. This dataset contains Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Islamic, Judaic, and Sikh places of worship. Unitarian places of worship have been included when a congregation from one of these religions meets at a church owned by a Unitarian congregation. Some Protestant denominations are not currently represented in this dataset. The Places of Worship dataset is not intended to include homes of religious leaders (unless they also serve as a place of organized worship), religious schools (unless they also serve as a place of organized worship for people other than those enrolled in the school), Jewish Mikvahs or Hillel facilities, and buildings that serve a purely administrative purpose. If a building's primary purpose is something other than worship (e.g., a community center, a public school), but a religious group uses the building for worship on a regular basis, it was included in this dataset if it otherwise met the criteria for inclusion. Convents and monasteries are included in this dataset, regardless of whether or not the facilities are open to the public, because religious services are regularly held at these locations. TGS was not tasked with ensuring the completeness of this layer. No entities are included in this dataset for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. On 08/07/2007, TGS ceased making phone calls to verify information about religious locations. Therefore, most entities in this dataset were verified using alternative reference sources such as topographic maps, parcel maps, various sources of imagery, and internet research. The [CONTHOW] (contact how) value for these entities has been set to ALT REF. The website http://www.gettochurch.org was used for verification during processing. As of August 2009, this website is no longer active.
