This data is updated every 2 minutes; 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.?Note: This is an Esri Feature Collection which is different than an Esri Feature Service. Feature Collections allow for high-availability. There are unique characteristics that need to be considered when using this data type:?It is a file-based data type so there is no REST endpoint. However, there is JSON that can be parsed out. See link at the bottom of this page.You cannot set a refresh interval in the map document, you must use the Info Summary Widget inside an application or hard-code the refresh in a custom application.The rotation setting gets wiped out each time the dataset is updated. When you add a feature collection to a new map, you will have to set the rotation. If you have an existing saved map this doesn?t apply to you.?",2017-06-12T13:19:52.000Z,2017-06-12T14:00:34.000Z,http://public-iowadot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/307b8c6f2226461e96bf3d147096ba5f,http://iowadot.maps.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/8d32316ba4e245318356b6be13ae909b/data,"-96.783,40.259,-90.059,43.593",http://public-iowadot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/307b8c6f2226461e96bf3d147096ba5f
