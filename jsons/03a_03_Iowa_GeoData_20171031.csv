dcat:Dataset,public,"Howe&#039;s, Mary",mailto:noemailprovided@usa.gov,"<p>Iowa Coal Mines compiles together information about past mining that was held by the State of Iowa including scanned copies of the mine maps and details about individual mines. The primary intent is to provide information to evaluate potential impacts to the land surface from the historic coal mines, although the data may also be useful for historical and scientific research. Coal was mined in Iowa beginning in the 1840's and ending in 1994. The mines operated in the southern and central areas of the state using both surface and underground methods. Based on available records, it is estimated that over 6,000 individual mines may have operated in Iowa during the state’s 150 year mining history. Approximately 3,000 of these mines can be located to at least one section with about half of those known as points only. The remaining mines leave some information about the area that they operated in. Starting about 1880, the Office of State Mine Inspectors was established to regulate the mining industry to help insure the miners’ safety. One of the requirements enacted at that time was that the mines employing more than four miners would submit detailed mine maps to the State Mine Inspectors every other year. Many of the mines that were exempt from this requirement were very small, local mines that operated to supply a few households. A large number of these mines may not be represented in this dataset.</p>

The Iowa Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) Project collects location and elevation (X, Y, Z) data to a set standard for the entire state of Iowa.</p>
<p>LIDAR is defined as an airborne laser system, flown aboard rotary or fixed-wing aircraft, that is used to acquire x, y, and z coordinates of terrain and terrain features that are both manmade and naturally occurring. LIDAR systems consist of a light-emitting scanning laser, an airborne Global Positioning System (GPS) with attendant GPS base station(s), and an Inertial Measuring Unit (IMU).</p>
<p>The laser scanning system measures ranges from the scanning laser to terrain surfaces by measuring the time it takes for the emitted light (LIDAR return) to reach the earth's surface and reflect back to the onboard LIDAR detector.</p>
<p>The airborne GPS system ascertains the in-flight three-dimensional position of the sensor, and the IMU delivers precise information about the attitude of the sensor. The LIDAR system incorporates data from these three subsystems to produce a large cloud of points on the land surface whose X, Y, and Z coordinates are known within the specified accuracy.</p>
<p>This collection consists of ASCII files of bare earth elevations and intensity (x,y,z,i) and, LAS (version 1.0 lidar data interchange standard) binary files that include all 1st and last returns, intensity and bare earth classification.</p>

dcat:Dataset,public,IowaDNR,mailto:noemailprovided@usa.gov,"<p>This High Resolution Landcover product was derived from three dates of aerial imagery, and from elevation information derived from LiDAR elevation data. It has a spatial resolution of one meter, and a class resolution of 15 classes. The target year for the interpretation of the classification is 2009. The Imagery sources are the 2008 NAIP imagery, the 2009 NAIP imagery, and the Four band Spring imagery collected in 2007, 2009 and 2010. Three dates were used because previous experimentation had shown that using fewer dates lacked sufficient spectral information to produce a reasonably consistent classification at the level required. Because each of these imagery layers were collected at widely different dates, to produce consistent classifications required breaking the state into regions or ""tiles"" with consistent spectral character. More than 580 such tiles were utilized statewide. Each was independently processed, and separately interpreted and checked. The final products were mosaicked together, then broken out into county files, which is how the files are presented in the NRGIS Library. Although we have done the best job we could to maintain consistency between these many files, it is impossible to maintain absolute consistency in even a small set of files, let alone this large number. The LiDAR data utilized was created by subtracting the Bare Earth DEM from the First Return DEM, yielding a normalized elevation model, which represents the elevation above ground surface of buildings, trees and other vegetation. This layer made an important contribution to producing an accurate classification of buildings and forests. A series of post classification steps were performed to correct problems which were consistent enough to be remedied by this kind of solution. These included embedding rasterized roads, recoding certain shadows, and using the LiDAR to refine building footprints, among others.</p>

These products are non-regulatory resources that supplement the flood hazard information produced by the regulatory Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and FIRM database products.

It is updated on a monthly basis. The FIRM Database is the digital, geospatial version of the flood hazard information shown on the published paper FIRMs.<br />
The FIRM Database depicts flood risk information and supporting data used to develop the risk data. The primary risk classifications used are the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event, the 0.2-percent-annual-chance flood event, and areas of minimal flood risk. The FIRM Database is derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published FIRMs, flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data, where available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by FEMA.<br />
The NFHL is available as State or US Territory data sets. Each State or Territory data set consists of all FIRM Databases and corresponding LOMRs available on the publication date of the data set.<br />
The specification for the horizontal control of FIRM Databases is consistent with those required for mapping at a scale of 1:12,000. This file is georeferenced to the Earth's surface using the Geographic Coordinate System (GCS) and North American Datum of 1983.</p>

The third shapefile shows areas where scour predictions made using this methodology have low confidence and a more detailed study is recommended.
