Fields contained in this layer include:Intermediary calculation fields for the aforementioned analysis.PartPop2: The total population estimated to live within the low food access area polygon (derived from Census tract population, assuming even distribution across the polygon after removing non-residential areas, followed by the removal of population living within a grocery store radius.)PrtOver185: The portion of PartPop2 which is estimated to have household income above 185% of the federal poverty line (the food secure population)PrtUnd185: The portion of PartPop2 which is estimated to have household income below 185% of the federal poverty line (the food insecure population)PercentUnd185: A calculated field showing PrtUnd185 as a percent of PartPop2. This is the percent of the population in the polygon which is food insecure (both living in a low food access area and below 185% of the federal poverty line).?Note that the polygon representing Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling was removed from this analysis.

Due to the frequent changing of these locations for farmers' market seasonal openings and closings, check DPW's website at?https://dpw.dc.gov/foodwastedropoff?for the most up-to-date locations.This dataset contains the following information about each location:Ward: The ward served by the drop-off location.MarketName: Name of the farmers' market hosting the drop-off.Address: Address of the farmers' market hosting the drop-off.SeasonOpen: Date on which the host farmers' market opens for the season.SeasonClose: Date on which the host farmers' market closes for the season.DropDay: Day on which residents may visit the host farmers' market to drop off food waste.DropTimes: Hours during which the drop-off will be open on the Drop Day.Last updated in November 2017.",2018-03-19T16:28:55.000Z,2018-03-22T18:41:31.000Z,http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/e7b2cf859b584a899ca3a3fe67095695_59,https://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/rest/services/DCGIS_DATA/Public_Service_WebMercator/MapServer/59,"-77.068653,38.842423,-76.948944,38.956218"
