http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/274f7c2b5f7c4ae19f165d9951057a00,Buildings 3D - Detailed Roof,"This dataset contains
3D rooftops for the District of Columbia in ESRI multipatch format. It includes
structures originally captured from 2005 aerial imagery together with updates
based on 2010 aerial imagery. It was produced under contract to the District of
Columbia by CyberCity3D, Inc. using stereo imagery and a proprietary extraction
process that identifies roof polygon points and then creates entire structures
from them to form roof polygons.Attributes containing roof height, slope and
orientation are included. This dataset is an update to a previous 3D dataset
produced in 2006 using 2005 imagery. It specifically includes updates to
building rooftops identified in the course of the District of Columbia?s
separate planimetric update effort, which noted structures known that were
added, modified between or deleted between 2008 and 2010. Although it was
intended to capture all new buildings irrespective of whether or not they were
identified through the planimetric update process, it is likely that building
rooftop changes not identified through the planimetric update process may not
have been captured.?

This dataset contains
rooftops, including protrusions such as gabled windows, chimneys, elevator
utility rooms, etc.. There were also additional datasets delivered which broke
out those roof elements into separate files, as well as deliveries which included
complete 3D buildings with rooftops and facades. In many instances, row-houses
and other contiguous building rooftops could not be broken apart using the
process methodology and appear as a single structure. In some cases, entire
blocks of row houses are represented as a single feature, though visually they
can be distinguished easily. Additionally, the process captured small features,
such as canopy umbrellas and other structures as building rooftops and these
features may exist at various locations in the dataset.Many data gaps in the
earlier dataset (largely due to missing or reduced-resolution source imagery)
are corrected in this product. Based on comparison to DC?s available
planimetric datasets, there are still instances where particular structures are
omitted or not updated in the current product, but we believe that upwards of

The DFIRM Database is derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data, where available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The file is georeferenced to earth's surface using the UTM projection and coordinate system.

http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/1b38bd7ce3704a25a38f35aa87a9517b_21,Urban Tree Canopy at Parcel Level,"Urban Tree Canopy (UTC) Assessment for Washington, DC. This dataset consists of UTC metrics summarized at the parcel level. The UTC Assessment is a top-down approach to analyzing the urban forest. Its purpose is to integrate high resolution land cover data with other GIS datasets to produce a set of detailed metrics on the urban forest that allow decision makers to know how much tree canopy currently exists (termed Existing UTC) and amount of land where is it biophysically feasible to establish tree canopy on (termed Possible UTC). Existing UTC is determined by extracting all features classified as tree canopy from a high resolution land cover dataset. Possible UTC is determined by identifying land where canopy could possibly exist and includes two subcategories: Possible-impervious and Possible-vegetation. Possible-impervious consists of all impervious land that, through modification, could support tree canopy. Examples of such features are sidewalks, minor driveways (through overhanging coverage), and playgrounds. Possible-vegetation consists of all land that is low-lying vegetation, primarily grass or shrubs, which could conceivably be converted to support tree canopy. Examples of such features include residential lawns and playing fields. Possible-vegetation also includes bare earth where no vegetation or impervious surfaces currently exist. UTC metrics do not serve to address the issues of where it is socially desirable or financially feasible to plant trees. Rather, the UTC metrics serve as the basis for beginning to form answers to these questions. UTC metrics are presented in the attribute table as both absolute area (in square meters) and relative area (percentage of land area) per parcel. For example, an Existing UTC Area (UTC_E_A) value of 13,677 and an Existing UTC Percentage (UTC_E_P) of 21.8 indicate that for the parcel in question the area of Existing UTC is 13,677 (in square meters) and 21.8% of that feature is tree canopy. Key parcel attributes have been maintained to assist in joining this table to the original parcel layer. The land cover dataset used to derive the UTC metrics for this dataset was generated from Quickbird color-infrared imagery acquired on September 7, 2006. Cadastral data (ownership parcels) were current as of January 26, 2009.",2015-02-27T20:55:45.000Z,2017-08-09T15:28:19.000Z,http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/1b38bd7ce3704a25a38f35aa87a9517b_21,https://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/rest/services/DCGIS_DATA/Environment_WebMercator/MapServer/21,"-77.1194137968,38.801593412,-76.9092582345,38.995976663",http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/1b38bd7ce3704a25a38f35aa87a9517b_21

The specifications for the horizontal control of DFIRM data files are consistent with those required for mapping at a scale of 1:12000.?Insurance applications include enforcement of the mandatory purchase requirement of the Flood Disaster Protection Act, which ... requires the purchase of flood insurance by property owners who are being assisted by Federal programs or by Federally supervised, regulated or insured agencies or institutions in the acquisition or improvement of land facilities located or to be located in identified areas having special flood hazards, Section 2 (b) (4) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973. In addition to the identification of Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs), the risk zones shown on the FIRMs are the basis for the establishment of premium rates for flood coverage offered through the NFIP. The DFIRM Database presents the flood risk information depicted on the FIRM in a digital format suitable for use in electronic mapping applications. The DFIRM database is a subset of the Digital FIS database that serves to archive the information collected during the FIS.",2015-02-27T20:55:37.000Z,2017-08-09T15:26:55.000Z,http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/fa630de4d78548c781df598189e996ee_6,https://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/rest/services/DCGIS_DATA/Environment_WebMercator/MapServer/6,"-77.1198379482,38.7975769855,-76.9105817344,38.9948895166",http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/fa630de4d78548c781df598189e996ee_6

Please refer to the?common ownership polygon layer?in?http://data.dc.gov?for the most current data on ownership.Property Owner Points. This dataset contains points that represent the approximate location of real property lots within the District of Columbia. Each property point is generated based on a corresponding record maintained within the Office of Tax and Revenue (OTR) Real Property Tax Administration's (RPTA) real property database. Each point contains the full attribution of database fields derived from ITS public release extract. The initial data conversion effort was begun in 1997 as a means to provide RPTA with a digital mapping system which could be maintained to reflect ongoing changes to property lots and ownership. The initial step was to scan RPTA tax square maps from aperture cards at an effective paper resolution of 400 DPI. The resulting images were then georeferenced to DC's 0.2-meter resolution 1995 digital orthophotos. During the georeferencing process, the images were not warped; they were simply scaled and rotated to best fit the orthophotos. The DC tax assessor provided a database of active tax accounts which were placed interactively by an operator using the georeferenced square image and the orthophoto. Centroids were placed on the primary structure visible in the orthophoto within the raster property polygon. The placement was performed within ArcView 3.2 using a customized data production application. Accounts which could not be placed in the first pass were then reviewed by another operator to attempt to find their correct location. The placed points were QC'd through a spatial overlay with the square index to assure a match between the square field value within the property database and the actual square polygon into which the point was placed. Spot checking was then performed to confirm that the centroids fell within the correct raster lot. The centroids were delivered to OTR as a single citywide AutoCAD DWG file. Attribute features with square, suffix, and lot numbers (SSLs) were included as an AutoCAD block.

Although it was intended to capture all new buildings irrespective of whether or not they were identified through the planimetric update process, it is likely that building changes not identified through the planimetric update process may not have been captured. It also uses an updated production process that addresses base elevation errors in the earlier product, where some buildings appeared to be taller than they were because the earlier production process had left them floating above the desired surface and this had been corrected by extending the walls of those structures down to the desired surface.This dataset contains full buildings (including facades and detailed rooftops. There were also additional datasets delivered which broke out those elements into separate facades, complete roofs, and roof elements (protruding gabled windows, chimneys, elevator utility rooms, etc.).In many instances, row-houses and other contiguous buildings could not be broken apart using the process methodology and appear as a single structure.",2016-03-08T21:53:27.000Z,2017-08-09T15:25:55.000Z,http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/ecae0a9a7cc24b418ce6eade7433b25a,https://drive.google.com/a/dc.gov/file/d/0B1Wt8FRXoFfJamhPUkEtdEh0TGs/view,"-77.176,38.755,-76.896,39.035",http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/ecae0a9a7cc24b418ce6eade7433b25a

This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory of soils and miscellaneous areas that normally occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and management.

Due to technology advances, expanding user base needs, and aging data, DC GIS acquired new LIDAR data in spring 2015 to establish a more thorough and better quality core LIDAR dataset The LiDAR data products are suitable for 1 foot (or less) contour generation.Intensity images generated from the RPC data for the DC OCTO 2015 LiDAR project covering approximately 80 square miles, in which its extents cover Arlington County in Washington DC. Intensity is a measure, collected for every point, of the return strength of the laser pulse that generated the point. It is based, in part, on the reflectivity of the object struck by the laser pulse.

This dataset consists of UTC metrics summarized by ward. The UTC Assessment is a top-down approach to analyzing the urban forest. Its purpose is to integrate high resolution land cover data with other GIS datasets to produce a set of detailed metrics on the urban forest that allow decision makers to know how much tree canopy currently exists (termed Existing UTC) and amount of land where is it biophysically feasible to establish tree canopy on (termed Possible UTC). Existing UTC is determined by extracting all features classified as tree canopy from a high resolution land cover dataset. Possible UTC is determined by identifying land where canopy could possibly exist and includes two subcategories: Possible-impervious and Possible-vegetation. Possible-impervious consists of all impervious land that, through modification, could support tree canopy. Examples of such features are sidewalks, minor driveways (through overhanging coverage), and playgrounds. Possible-vegetation consists of all land that is low-lying vegetation, primarily grass or shrubs, which could conceivably be converted to support tree canopy. Examples of such features include residential lawns and playing fields. Possible-vegetation also includes bare earth where no vegetation or impervious surfaces currently exist. UTC metrics do not serve to address the issues of where it is socially desirable or financially feasible to plant trees. Rather, the UTC metrics serve as the basis for beginning to form answers to these questions. UTC metrics are presented in the attribute table as both absolute area (in square meters) and relative area (percentage of land area) per parcel. For example, an Existing UTC Area (UTC_E_A) value of 13,677 and an Existing UTC Percentage (UTC_E_P) of 21.8 indicate that for the parcel in question the area of Existing UTC is 13,677 (in square meters) and 21.8% of that feature is tree canopy. Key ward attributes have been maintained to assist in joining this table to the original wards layer. The land cover dataset used to derive the UTC metrics for this dataset was generated from Quickbird color-infrared imagery acquired on September 7, 2006. The wards layer was current as of March 5, 2007.",2015-02-27T20:55:45.000Z,2017-12-21T20:27:24.827Z,http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/4919ca2fa0894de18e4752a5e16ca683_22,https://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/rest/services/DCGIS_DATA/Environment_WebMercator/MapServer/22,"-77.1198964251,38.7915818465,-76.9090163369,38.9959674016",http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/4919ca2fa0894de18e4752a5e16ca683_22

The Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM) Database depicts flood risk information and supporting data used to develop the risk data. The primary risk classifications used are the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event, the 0.2-percent-annual-chance flood event, and areas of minimal flood risk. The DFIRM Database is derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data, where available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The file is georeferenced to earth's surface using the UTM projection and coordinate system. The specifications for the horizontal control of DFIRM data files are consistent with those required for mapping at a scale of 1:12000.?Insurance applications include enforcement of the mandatory purchase requirement of the Flood Disaster Protection Act, which ... requires the purchase of flood insurance by property owners who are being assisted by Federal programs or by Federally supervised, regulated or insured agencies or institutions in the acquisition or improvement of land facilities located or to be located in identified areas having special flood hazards, Section 2 (b) (4) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973. In addition to the identification of Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs), the risk zones shown on the FIRMs are the basis for the establishment of premium rates for flood coverage offered through the NFIP. The DFIRM Database presents the flood risk information depicted on the FIRM in a digital format suitable for use in electronic mapping applications.

This document describes the processes used to create the orthoimagery data produced for the District of Columbia from 2015 digital aerial photography.??It was flown in mid to Late?April, completed on?April 24, 2015.?? Due to the low altitude flown to capture the complete imagery for the 2015 sensory flight, there is incomplete aerial photography coverage around the White House and the U.S. Capitol. For these areas, 2013 imagery was merged seamlessly using the street centerlines to define the 2013 merged areas. This minimized distortion of features.The project area covers the entire District of Columbia which is approximately 69 square miles. The digital imagery was used to create natural color digital orthophotography with 8cm pixel resolution. The final orthophotography deliverable products for this project consist of 328 ortho tiles at a scale of 1 to 2400. The tile dimensions are 800 meters by 800 meters. A corresponding MrSid image was created by mosaicing the 328 ortho tiles together and compressing the image using an 80 to 1 compression ration. All DC GIS data is stored and exported in Maryland State Plane coordinates NAD 83 meters. There are no coverage areas that are larger than the usual P56 (no fly zones). Areas outside of P56 that are redacted have been merged with 2013 - resampled to 3 inch (from 6 inch). Past flights were flown at 6,000 feet. The US Secret Service removed a larger area due to the lower flight.

Benchmarking is defined as tracking a building?s energy?and water use and using a standard metric to compare the building?s performance against past?performance and to its peers nationwide. These comparisons have been shown to drive energy?efficiency upgrades and increase occupancy rates and property values. The District of?Columbia has chosen U.S. EPA?s free, industry-standard ENERGY STAR? Portfolio Manager? tool?for benchmarking and reporting. DDOE is required to publicly disclose the ENERGY STAR??Benchmarking results for each privately owned building that is subject to the benchmarking?law, beginning with the 2nd year of benchmarking data for that building.
