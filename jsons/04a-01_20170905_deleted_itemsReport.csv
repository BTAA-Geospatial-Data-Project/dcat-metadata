Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses. Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy. In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas.Last Updated: UnknownFeature Service Layer Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Demographics/MD_CensusBoundaries/MapServer/2",2016-03-29T16:04:42.000Z,2017-08-17T16:12:22.443Z,http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/2cb6e7dfc87047ccaa38f59d955d907b_2,http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Demographics/MD_CensusBoundaries/MapServer/2,"-79.4877,37.9121,-75.0491,39.723",http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/2cb6e7dfc87047ccaa38f59d955d907b_2

Find more information at?http://imap.maryland.gov.This dataset contains areas in the Chesapeake Bay with low amounts of oxygen. Excessive nitrogen and phosphorus pollution from human activities cause dead zones?or areas with low amounts of oxygen in the Bay. With little or no oxygen, fish, crabs, oysters, and other aquatic animals literally suffocate. Further, an excess in these nutrients also fuels the growth of dense algae blooms that block sunlight that underwater grasses need to grow in order to continue providing food for waterfowl and shelter for blue crabs and juvenile fish.Last Updated: UnknownFeature Service Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Environment/MD_ChesapeakeBayDeadZones/FeatureServer/0",2016-02-09T17:00:12.000Z,2017-04-20T19:17:29.000Z,http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/2abad6ad2335468bb8c25648e9a6a106_0,http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Environment/MD_ChesapeakeBayDeadZones/FeatureServer/0,"-76.6269,37.4652,-75.5479,39.6004",http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/2abad6ad2335468bb8c25648e9a6a106_0
