Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.This dataset provides the Tier II catchments delineated for the most downstream Tier II segment. This file also provides the assimilative capacity (AC) status for each watershed. In cases where there is no remaining AC in a nested catchment but the larger encompassing segment has remaining AC, the smaller nested catchment is split out and assigned its own identification. These nested catchments are also then attributed to show the lack of AC remaining. The intended use of the catchment dataset is to assist State, Local, and Federal officials and stakeholders in determining the antidegradation status of current or planned activities which fall under the purview of the antidegradation policy and implementation procedure (COMAR 26.08.02.04-1).  Using GIS, the stakeholder can assess if any activity, proposed or operational, such as a discharge, is located on land which drains (has run off) directly into and can potentially adversely affect a Tier II stream segment.  This type of determination would be useful for permitting purposes, screening for sensitive or high quality resources, and various land use planning activities such as those undertaken by local officials during the Water Resources Element process, Water and Sewer Planning, or the Comprehensive Planning process.Last Updated: November 2016Feature Service Layer Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Hydrology/MD_WaterQuality/FeatureServer/3",2016-02-10T18:05:59.000Z,2017-08-23T16:31:01.282Z,http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/c83e66c46c694ffb9b99bda1dc507ed0_3,http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Hydrology/MD_WaterQuality/FeatureServer/3,"-79.5073,38.0147,-75.3428,39.9149",http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/c83e66c46c694ffb9b99bda1dc507ed0_3

Find more information on?http://imap.maryland.gov.The Clean Water Act requires three components to water quality standards that set goals for and protect each States' waters. The three components are: (1) designated uses that set goals for each water body (e.g., recreational use), (2) criteria that set the minimum conditions to support the use (e.g., bacterial concentrations below certain concentrations) and (3) an antidegradation policy that maintains high quality waters so they are not allowed to degrade to meet only the minimum standards. The designated uses and criteria set the minimum standards for Tier I. Maryland's antidegradation policy has been promulgated in three regulations within the Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR): COMAR 26.08.02.04 sets out the policy itself, COMAR 26.08.02.04-1, which is discussed here, provides for implementation of Tier II (high quality waters) of the antidegradation policy, and COMAR 26.08.02.04-2 that describes Tier III (Outstanding National Resource Waters or ONRW), the highest quality waters. No Tier III waters have been designated at this time. Tier II antidegradation implementation has the greatest immediate effect on local government planning functions so the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) has prepared this set of Tier II GIS data layers to provide technical assistance to local governments working to complete the Water Resources Element of their comprehensive plans as required by HB 1141. As part of this process, MDE has created this dataset representing the official record of all Maryland Tier II (high quality) stream segments as determined by MDE, the regulatory agency responsible for identification and listing of Maryland's Tier II waters. This dataset consists of a digital geospatial representation of all identified Tier II segments which includes those stream segments promulgated in (COMAR) 26.08.02.04-1, and those additional segments proposed during the current Triennial Review of Maryland Regulations, known as the pending list. Pending segments are Tier II segments awaiting promulgation. This is a vector line file that was developed using the 24,000:1 scale National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) coverage for Maryland, and each identified Tier II stream segment has been linked to the NHD using the unique common identifier (COMID) code. MDE uses Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) data for designating streams as Tier II. Using all MBSS stations sampled within a stream reach (defined as a section of stream from confluence to confluence), an arithmetic mean of the benthic index of biotic integrity (IBI) and the fish IBI is calculated. Only if the means of both the benthic and fish IBIs are greater than or equal to 4.00 is a stream reach designated as Tier II. As such, Tier II streams represent the best streams in Maryland in terms of water quality, water chemistry, habitat, and biotic assemblages. Tier II stream segments can range in length generally terminating at confluences, impoundment outfalls, and tidal boundaries. However, in planning activities, one should consider the entire upstream watershed to a Tier II stream as any changes to this watershed can potentially have an effect on the water quality of the Tier II stream. It is worth noting that once a stream segment is designated as Tier II, this designation lasts in perpetuity regardless of changes in water quality or local landuse.

Find more information on?http://imap.maryland.gov.The Rivers_Streams feature class is the geospatial representation for linear bodies of water (e.g. rivers, streams, artificial paths for tidal waters, shorelines, etc) within Maryland's borders. This feature class is linked by relationship class to data from the 2012 Integrated Report of Surface Water Quality. This link allows for users to query water quality assessment information spatially and facilitates the development of other customized visuals. This feature class is built upon the USGS National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) which was generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale. Note: This single feature class is one of a set of feature classes (7) that geospatially depict Maryland's assessment units in non-tidal streams, tidal water bodies, and impounded waters. Each of these feature classes correspond to a specific assessment scale (streams, impoundments, estuarine segments) within Maryland.Map Service Link:?http://mdewin64.mde.state.md.us/arcgis/rest/services/MDE_Water_Quality/MD_IntegratedReport_SurfaceWaterQuality2014/MapServer/6",2017-08-22T15:30:04.000Z,2017-08-22T15:32:00.791Z,http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/b5716683f76b46b486e2eb0b06e3d7ae_6,http://mdewin64.mde.state.md.us/arcgis/rest/services/MDE_Water_Quality/MD_IntegratedReport_SurfaceWaterQuality2014/MapServer/6,"-79.5076,37.8841,-75.0138,39.747",http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/b5716683f76b46b486e2eb0b06e3d7ae_6

Find more information on?http://imap.maryland.gov.The Clean Water Act requires three components to water quality standards that set goals for and protect each States' waters. The three components are: (1) designated uses that set goals for each water body (e.g., recreational use), (2) criteria that set the minimum conditions to support the use (e.g., bacterial concentrations below certain concentrations) and (3) an antidegradation policy that maintains high quality waters so they are not allowed to degrade to meet only the minimum standards. The designated uses and criteria set the minimum standards for Tier I. Maryland's antidegradation policy has been promulgated in three regulations within the Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR): COMAR 26.08.02.04 sets out the policy itself, COMAR 26.08.02.04-1, which is discussed here, provides for implementation of Tier II (high quality waters) of the antidegradation policy, and COMAR 26.08.02.04-2 that describes Tier III (Outstanding National Resource Waters or ONRW), the highest quality waters. No Tier III waters have been designated at this time. Tier II antidegradation implementation has the greatest immediate effect on local government planning functions so the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) has prepared this set of Tier II GIS data layers to provide technical assistance to local governments working to complete the Water Resources Element of their comprehensive plans as required by HB 1141. As part of this process, MDE has created this dataset representing the official record of all Maryland Tier II (high quality) stream segments as determined by MDE, the regulatory agency responsible for identification and listing of Maryland's Tier II waters. This dataset consists of a digital geospatial representation of all identified Tier II segments which includes those stream segments promulgated in (COMAR) 26.08.02.04-1, and those additional segments proposed during the current Triennial Review of Maryland Regulations, known as the pending list. Pending segments are Tier II segments awaiting promulgation. This is a vector line file that was developed using the 24,000:1 scale National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) coverage for Maryland, and each identified Tier II stream segment has been linked to the NHD using the unique common identifier (COMID) code. MDE uses Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) data for designating streams as Tier II. Using all MBSS stations sampled within a stream reach (defined as a section of stream from confluence to confluence), an arithmetic mean of the benthic index of biotic integrity (IBI) and the fish IBI is calculated. Only if the means of both the benthic and fish IBIs are greater than or equal to 4.00 is a stream reach designated as Tier II. As such, Tier II streams represent the best streams in Maryland in terms of water quality, water chemistry, habitat, and biotic assemblages. Tier II stream segments can range in length generally terminating at confluences, impoundment outfalls, and tidal boundaries. However, in planning activities, one should consider the entire upstream watershed to a Tier II stream as any changes to this watershed can potentially have an effect on the water quality of the Tier II stream. It is worth noting that once a stream segment is designated as Tier II, this designation lasts in perpetuity regardless of changes in water quality or local landuse.
