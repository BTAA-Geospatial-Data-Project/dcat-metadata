culture industry returns $80 million in local tax revenue to the District’s coffers.  These trends create an opportunity for DCCAH to position itself at the forefront of the city’s cultural planning.

This dataset contains points that represent the approximate location of real property lots within the District of Columbia. Each property point is generated based on a corresponding record maintained within the Office of Tax and Revenue (OTR) Real Property Tax Administration's (RPTA) real property database. Each point contains the full attribution of database fields derived from ITS public release extract. The initial data conversion effort was begun in 1997 as a means to provide RPTA with a digital mapping system which could be maintained to reflect ongoing changes to property lots and ownership. The initial step was to scan RPTA tax square maps from aperture cards at an effective paper resolution of 400 DPI. The resulting images were then georeferenced to DC's 0.2-meter resolution 1995 digital orthophotos. During the georeferencing process, the images were not warped; they were simply scaled and rotated to best fit the orthophotos. The DC tax assessor provided a database of active tax accounts which were placed interactively by an operator using the georeferenced square image and the orthophoto. Centroids were placed on the primary structure visible in the orthophoto within the raster property polygon. The placement was performed within ArcView 3.2 using a customized data production application. Accounts which could not be placed in the first pass were then reviewed by another operator to attempt to find their correct location. The placed points were QC'd through a spatial overlay with the square index to assure a match between the &quot;square&quot; field value within the property database and the actual square polygon into which the point was placed.

This dataset consists of UTC metrics summarized at the parcel level. The UTC Assessment is a top-down approach to analyzing the urban forest. Its purpose is to integrate high resolution land cover data with other GIS datasets to produce a set of detailed metrics on the urban forest that allow decision makers to know how much tree canopy currently exists (termed Existing UTC) and amount of land where is it biophysically feasible to establish tree canopy on (termed Possible UTC). Existing UTC is determined by extracting all features classified as tree canopy from a high resolution land cover dataset. Possible UTC is determined by identifying land where canopy could possibly exist and includes two subcategories: Possible-impervious and Possible-vegetation. Possible-impervious consists of all impervious land that, through modification, could support tree canopy. Examples of such features are sidewalks, minor driveways (through overhanging coverage), and playgrounds. Possible-vegetation consists of all land that is low-lying vegetation, primarily grass or shrubs, which could conceivably be converted to support tree canopy. Examples of such features include residential lawns and playing fields. Possible-vegetation also includes bare earth where no vegetation or impervious surfaces currently exist. UTC metrics do not serve to address the issues of where it is socially desirable or financially feasible to plant trees. Rather, the UTC metrics serve as the basis for beginning to form answers to these questions. UTC metrics are presented in the attribute table as both absolute area (in square meters) and relative area (percentage of land area) per parcel. For example, an Existing UTC Area (UTC_E_A) value of 13,677 and an Existing UTC Percentage (UTC_E_P) of 21.8 indicate that for the parcel in question the area of Existing UTC is 13,677 (in square meters) and 21.8% of that feature is tree canopy. Key parcel attributes have been maintained to assist in joining this table to the original parcel layer. The land cover dataset used to derive the UTC metrics for this dataset was generated from Quickbird color-infrared imagery acquired on September 7, 2006. Cadastral data (ownership parcels) were current as of January 26, 2009.","keyword":["Open Data","Washington DC","DC GIS","District of Columbia","Environment","Environmental","location","Property","Lot","Cadastral","Washington","DC","DC","Land","Square","DCGIS","Land Cover","Urban","Imagery","Ownership Parcels","Forest Opportunity Spectrum","UTC","Tree Canopy","Existing","FOS","September 7","2006","Possible"],"issued":"2015-02-27T20:55:45.000Z","modified":"2017-03-03T19:15:10.310Z","publisher":{"name":"City of Washington, DC"},"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"DC GIS Opendata","hasEmail":"mailto:gisgroup@dc.gov?subject= DC AGO Question or Comment"},"accessLevel":"public","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"ArcGIS Open Dataset","format":"Web page","mediaType":"text/html","accessURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/1b38bd7ce3704a25a38f35aa87a9517b_21"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Esri Rest API","format":"Esri REST","mediaType":"application/json","accessURL":"http://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/rest/services/DCGIS_DATA/Environment_WebMercator/MapServer/21"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"GeoJSON","format":"GeoJSON","mediaType":"application/vnd.geo+json","downloadURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/1b38bd7ce3704a25a38f35aa87a9517b_21.geojson"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"CSV","format":"CSV","mediaType":"text/csv","downloadURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/1b38bd7ce3704a25a38f35aa87a9517b_21.csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"KML","format":"KML","mediaType":"application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml","downloadURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/1b38bd7ce3704a25a38f35aa87a9517b_21.kml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Shapefile","format":"ZIP","mediaType":"application/zip","downloadURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/1b38bd7ce3704a25a38f35aa87a9517b_21.zip"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"OGC WMS","format":"OGC WMS","mediaType":"application/vnd.ogc.wms_xml","accessURL":"http://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/services/DCGIS_DATA/Environment_WebMercator/MapServer/WMSServer?request=GetCapabilities&service=WMS"}],"landingPage":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/1b38bd7ce3704a25a38f35aa87a9517b_21","webService":"http://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/rest/services/DCGIS_DATA/Environment_WebMercator/MapServer/21","license":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/1b38bd7ce3704a25a38f35aa87a9517b_21/license.json","spatial":"-77.1194137968,38.801593412,-76.9092582345,38.995976663","theme":["geospatial"]},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","identifier":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/3d1134fc54694ae5a0ad9d0f3f515863_59","title":"Land Boundary Changes - 2015","description":"Owner polygons.

For analysis purposes, RPTA delineates assessment neighborhoods to group properties that are affected by similar economic, political, governmental, and environmental factors. Assessment neighborhoods are defined by the environment of a subject property that has a direct and immediate effect on its value. The assessment neighborhood is a geographic area (in which there are typically fewer than several thousand properties) defined for some useful purpose, such as to ensure for later multiple regression modeling that the properties are homogeneous and share important locational characteristics. Assessment neighborhoods boundaries typically follow street centerlines, hydrological boundaries, and boundaries of major properties such as parks and monuments. The current feature class was created by selecting coincident features from the DC GIS snapbase. These included road centerlines, stream centerlines, water boundaries, rail lines, and DC political boundaries. After a new feature class was created, any additional lines required for polygon closure were snapped to existing features using a tolerance of .001 meters.","keyword":["Washington","DC","District of Columbia","DC GIS","DCGIS","Assessment neighborhoods","RPTA neighborhoods","Assessment neighborhood areas"],"issued":"2015-02-27T21:09:48.000Z","modified":"2017-03-03T19:14:06.062Z","publisher":{"name":"City of Washington, DC"},"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"DC GIS Opendata","hasEmail":"mailto:gisgroup@dc.gov?subject= DC AGO Question or Comment"},"accessLevel":"public","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"ArcGIS Open Dataset","format":"Web page","mediaType":"text/html","accessURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/f1c50ea5db704ed39f753f16dff964af_6"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Esri Rest API","format":"Esri REST","mediaType":"application/json","accessURL":"http://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/rest/services/DCGIS_DATA/Property_and_Land_WebMercator/MapServer/6"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"GeoJSON","format":"GeoJSON","mediaType":"application/vnd.geo+json","downloadURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/f1c50ea5db704ed39f753f16dff964af_6.geojson"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"CSV","format":"CSV","mediaType":"text/csv","downloadURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/f1c50ea5db704ed39f753f16dff964af_6.csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"KML","format":"KML","mediaType":"application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml","downloadURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/f1c50ea5db704ed39f753f16dff964af_6.kml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Shapefile","format":"ZIP","mediaType":"application/zip","downloadURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/f1c50ea5db704ed39f753f16dff964af_6.zip"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"OGC WMS","format":"OGC WMS","mediaType":"application/vnd.ogc.wms_xml","accessURL":"http://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/services/DCGIS_DATA/Property_and_Land_WebMercator/MapServer/WMSServer?request=GetCapabilities&service=WMS"}],"landingPage":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/f1c50ea5db704ed39f753f16dff964af_6","webService":"http://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/rest/services/DCGIS_DATA/Property_and_Land_WebMercator/MapServer/6","license":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/f1c50ea5db704ed39f753f16dff964af_6/license.json","spatial":"-77.1167293408,38.8030573836,-76.9090163751,38.9959673777","theme":["geospatial"]},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","identifier":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/6da0781990494f678e9f5722e1c09a67_23","title":"Neighborhood Investment Fund (NIF) Areas","description":"The dataset contains locations and attributes of Neighborhood Investment Fund Areas, created as part of the DC Geographic Information System (DC GIS) for the D.C.

The Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM) Database depicts flood risk information and supporting data used to develop the risk data. The primary risk classifications used are the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event, the 0.2-percent-annual-chance flood event, and areas of minimal flood risk. The DFIRM Database is derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data, where available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The file is georeferenced to earth's surface using the UTM projection and coordinate system. The specifications for the horizontal control of DFIRM data files are consistent with those required for mapping at a scale of 1:12000.<div><br /></div><div> Insurance applications include enforcement of the mandatory purchase requirement of the Flood Disaster Protection Act, which &quot;... requires the purchase of flood insurance by property owners who are being assisted by Federal programs or by Federally supervised, regulated or insured agencies or institutions in the acquisition or improvement of land facilities located or to be located in identified areas having special flood hazards,&quot; Section 2 (b) (4) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973. In addition to the identification of Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs), the risk zones shown on the FIRMs are the basis for the establishment of premium rates for flood coverage offered through the NFIP. The DFIRM Database presents the flood risk information depicted on the FIRM in a digital format suitable for use in electronic mapping applications. The DFIRM database is a subset of the Digital FIS database that serves to archive the information collected during the FIS.<br /></div>","keyword":["Open Data","Washington DC","DC GIS","District of Columbia","Environment","Environmental","Transportation","DFIRM","COUNTY DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA","Riverine Flooding","COUNTYFIPS 11001","Hydrology","Floodway","Base Flood Elevation","Inland Waters","FEMA Flood Hazard Zone","FIRM","DFIRM Database","Structure","Special Flood Hazard Area","NFIP","Elevation","COMMUNITY WASHINGTON","Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map","Flood Insurance Rate Map","SFHA","STATE DC","FEMACID 110001","REGION 03"],"issued":"2015-02-27T20:55:38.000Z","modified":"2017-03-03T19:10:05.308Z","publisher":{"name":"City of Washington, DC"},"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"DC GIS Opendata","hasEmail":"mailto:gisgroup@dc.gov?subject= DC AGO Question or Comment"},"accessLevel":"public","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"ArcGIS Open Dataset","format":"Web page","mediaType":"text/html","accessURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/8d5233f024b64fa1a042dcd04e66e9ed_8"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Esri Rest API","format":"Esri REST","mediaType":"application/json","accessURL":"http://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/rest/services/DCGIS_DATA/Environment_WebMercator/MapServer/8"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"GeoJSON","format":"GeoJSON","mediaType":"application/vnd.geo+json","downloadURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/8d5233f024b64fa1a042dcd04e66e9ed_8.geojson"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"CSV","format":"CSV","mediaType":"text/csv","downloadURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/8d5233f024b64fa1a042dcd04e66e9ed_8.csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"KML","format":"KML","mediaType":"application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml","downloadURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/8d5233f024b64fa1a042dcd04e66e9ed_8.kml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Shapefile","format":"ZIP","mediaType":"application/zip","downloadURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/8d5233f024b64fa1a042dcd04e66e9ed_8.zip"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"OGC WMS","format":"OGC WMS","mediaType":"application/vnd.ogc.wms_xml","accessURL":"http://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/services/DCGIS_DATA/Environment_WebMercator/MapServer/WMSServer?request=GetCapabilities&service=WMS"}],"landingPage":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/8d5233f024b64fa1a042dcd04e66e9ed_8","webService":"http://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/rest/services/DCGIS_DATA/Environment_WebMercator/MapServer/8","license":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/8d5233f024b64fa1a042dcd04e66e9ed_8/license.json","spatial":"-77.1254388206,38.7499329283,-76.8745612069,39.0000667915","theme":["geospatial"]},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","identifier":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/a8813c4d05fe4edfa931517eeeebcd31_19","title":"Overlay Zones","description":"Overlay Districts are a zoning designation that modifies the basic underlying designation in some specific manner; this is what the Overlay polygons in the Zoning map represent.

ANC's consider a wide range of policies and programs affecting their neighborhoods. These include traffic, parking, recreation, street improvements, liquor licenses, zoning, economic development, police protection, sanitation and trash collection, and the District's annual budget. No public policy area is excluded from the purview of the Advisory Neighborhood Commissions. The intent of the ANC legislation is to ensure input from an advisory board made up of the residents of the neighborhoods directly affected by government action. The ANCs are the body of government with the closest official ties to the people in a neighborhood. ANCs present their positions and recommendations on issues to various District government agencies, the Executive Branch, and the Council. They also present testimony to independent agencies, boards and commissions, usually under rules of procedure specific to those entities.

This dataset contains points that represent the approximate location of real property lots within the District of Columbia. Each property point is generated based on a corresponding record maintained within the Office of Tax and Revenue (OTR) Real Property Tax Administration's (RPTA) real property database. Each point contains the full attribution of database fields derived from ITS public release extract. The initial data conversion effort was begun in 1997 as a means to provide RPTA with a digital mapping system which could be maintained to reflect ongoing changes to property lots and ownership. The initial step was to scan RPTA tax square maps from aperture cards at an effective paper resolution of 400 DPI. The resulting images were then georeferenced to DC's 0.2-meter resolution 1995 digital orthophotos. During the georeferencing process, the images were not warped; they were simply scaled and rotated to best fit the orthophotos. The DC tax assessor provided a database of active tax accounts which were placed interactively by an operator using the georeferenced square image and the orthophoto. Centroids were placed on the primary structure visible in the orthophoto within the raster property polygon. The placement was performed within ArcView 3.2 using a customized data production application. Accounts which could not be placed in the first pass were then reviewed by another operator to attempt to find their correct location. The placed points were QC'd through a spatial overlay with the square index to assure a match between the &quot;square&quot; field value within the property database and the actual square polygon into which the point was placed. Spot checking was then performed to confirm that the centroids fell within the correct raster lot. The centroids were delivered to OTR as a single citywide AutoCAD DWG file. Attribute features with square, suffix, and lot numbers (SSLs) were included as an AutoCAD block. All DC GIS data is stored and exported in Maryland State Plane coordinates NAD 83 meters.

The DFIRM Database is derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data, where available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The file is georeferenced to earth's surface using the UTM projection and coordinate system.

In addition to the identification of Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs), the risk zones shown on the FIRMs are the basis for the establishment of premium rates for flood coverage offered through the NFIP.

Blue 35 gallon recycling containers are distributed to citizens in the conventional area as they are in the supercan area, but in the densest areas some residents receive recyling bins that are easier to store and manuver in areas where on-street parking is tight.","keyword":["Open Data","Washington DC","DC GIS","District of Columbia","Public","Service","Public Service"],"issued":"2015-02-27T21:13:04.000Z","modified":"2017-03-03T19:08:00.149Z","publisher":{"name":"City of Washington, DC"},"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"DC GIS Opendata","hasEmail":"mailto:gisgroup@dc.gov?subject= DC AGO Question or Comment"},"accessLevel":"public","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"ArcGIS Open Dataset","format":"Web page","mediaType":"text/html","accessURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/c4667a508d5c40a5a50d1f94b46e9324_12"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Esri Rest API","format":"Esri REST","mediaType":"application/json","accessURL":"http://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/rest/services/DCGIS_DATA/Public_Service_WebMercator/MapServer/12"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"GeoJSON","format":"GeoJSON","mediaType":"application/vnd.geo+json","downloadURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/c4667a508d5c40a5a50d1f94b46e9324_12.geojson"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"CSV","format":"CSV","mediaType":"text/csv","downloadURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/c4667a508d5c40a5a50d1f94b46e9324_12.csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"KML","format":"KML","mediaType":"application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml","downloadURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/c4667a508d5c40a5a50d1f94b46e9324_12.kml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Shapefile","format":"ZIP","mediaType":"application/zip","downloadURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/c4667a508d5c40a5a50d1f94b46e9324_12.zip"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"OGC WMS","format":"OGC WMS","mediaType":"application/vnd.ogc.wms_xml","accessURL":"http://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/services/DCGIS_DATA/Public_Service_WebMercator/MapServer/WMSServer?request=GetCapabilities&service=WMS"}],"landingPage":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/c4667a508d5c40a5a50d1f94b46e9324_12","webService":"http://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/rest/services/DCGIS_DATA/Public_Service_WebMercator/MapServer/12","license":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/c4667a508d5c40a5a50d1f94b46e9324_12/license.json","spatial":"-77.073028395,38.8707210343,-76.9754594412,38.9374337055","theme":["geospatial"]},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","identifier":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/3d6013e432b14a9892752abb8fc69e58_27","title":"Wetland Types","description":"National Wetlands Inventory.

This dataset contains an extract of property owner points that represent sales within the past 24 months. Each point represents the approximate location of real property lots within the District of Columbia. Each property point is generated based on a corresponding record maintained within the Office of Tax and Revenue (OTR) Real Property Tax Administration's (RPTA) real property database. Each point contains the full attribution of database fields derived from ITS public release extract. The initial data conversion effort was begun in 1997 as a means to provide RPTA with a digital mapping system which could be maintained to reflect ongoing changes to property lots and ownership. The initial step was to scan RPTA tax square maps from aperture cards at an effective paper resolution of 400 DPI. The resulting images were then georeferenced to DC's 0.2-meter resolution 1995 digital orthophotos. During the georeferencing process, the images were not warped; they were simply scaled and rotated to best fit the orthophotos. The DC tax assessor provided a database of active tax accounts which were placed interactively by an operator using the georeferenced square image and the orthophoto. Centroids were placed on the primary structure visible in the orthophoto within the raster property polygon. The placement was performed within ArcView 3.2 using a customized data production application. Accounts which could not be placed in the first pass were then reviewed by another operator to attempt to find their correct location. The placed points were QC'd through a spatial overlay with the square index to assure a match between the &quot;square&quot; field value within the property database and the actual square polygon into which the point was placed. Spot checking was then performed to confirm that the centroids fell within the correct raster lot. The centroids were delivered to OTR as a single citywide AutoCAD DWG file. Attribute features with square, suffix, and lot numbers (SSLs) were included as an AutoCAD block. All DC GIS data is stored and exported in Maryland State Plane coordinates NAD 83 meters.

The geometries of each of these geographic areas can then be built by dissolving the face geometries on the appropriate key geographic area codes in the Topological Faces Shapefile.","keyword":["Legislative Session Year","New England County Metropolitan Area FIPS Code","Tabulation Block Number","State Legislative District Lower Chamber Code","County or equivalent entity","Topological Faces","Table","United States","106th congressional district Code","State FIPS Code","Tribal Subdivision Code","Census Tract Number","5Percent Public Use Microdata Area Code","Alaska Native Regional Corporation FIPS code","County FIPS Code","Metropolitan Statistical AreaConsolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area FIPS Code","boundaries","Landwater Flag","Unified School District Local Education Agency Code","5 digit ZIP Code Tabulation Area Code","Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area FIPS Code","Elementary School District Local Education Agency Code","11001","State Legislative District Upper Chamber Code","FIPS 55 Place Code For All Places","108th congressional district Code","1Percent Public Use Microdata Area Code","Urban Growth Area Code","Rreservation or Offreservation Trust Land Indicator","Traffic Analysis Zone Code","District of Columbia","Urban Area Code","Secondary School District Local Education Agency Code","Number","3 digit ZIP Code Tabulation Area Code","Voting District Code","County Subdivision FIPS Code","County or Equivalent Entity","Subminor Civil Division FIPS Code in Puerto Rico","US","Consolidated City FIPS Code","Block Group","American IndianAlaska NativeNative Hawaiian Areas Census Code"],"issued":"2015-02-27T20:47:52.000Z","modified":"2017-03-03T19:07:36.355Z","publisher":{"name":"City of Washington, DC"},"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"DC GIS Opendata","hasEmail":"mailto:gisgroup@dc.gov?subject= DC AGO Question or Comment"},"accessLevel":"public","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"ArcGIS Open Dataset","format":"Web page","mediaType":"text/html","accessURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/f88d947d0ba945b688e00a46d6cbcd6c_9"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Esri Rest API","format":"Esri REST","mediaType":"application/json","accessURL":"http://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/rest/services/DCGIS_DATA/Demographic_WebMercator/MapServer/9"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"GeoJSON","format":"GeoJSON","mediaType":"application/vnd.geo+json","downloadURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/f88d947d0ba945b688e00a46d6cbcd6c_9.geojson"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"CSV","format":"CSV","mediaType":"text/csv","downloadURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/f88d947d0ba945b688e00a46d6cbcd6c_9.csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"KML","format":"KML","mediaType":"application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml","downloadURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/f88d947d0ba945b688e00a46d6cbcd6c_9.kml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Shapefile","format":"ZIP","mediaType":"application/zip","downloadURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/f88d947d0ba945b688e00a46d6cbcd6c_9.zip"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"OGC WMS","format":"OGC WMS","mediaType":"application/vnd.ogc.wms_xml","accessURL":"http://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/services/DCGIS_DATA/Demographic_WebMercator/MapServer/WMSServer?request=GetCapabilities&service=WMS"}],"landingPage":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/f88d947d0ba945b688e00a46d6cbcd6c_9","webService":"http://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/rest/services/DCGIS_DATA/Demographic_WebMercator/MapServer/9","license":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/f88d947d0ba945b688e00a46d6cbcd6c_9/license.json","spatial":"-77.1198964251,38.7915818465,-76.9090163369,38.9959674016","theme":["geospatial"]},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","identifier":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/1ef41f3815d5433abc435604a489d29f_5","title":"Intermediate Care Facilities","description":"Intermediate Care Facility.

These comparisons have been shown to drive energy efficiency upgrades and increase occupancy rates and property values. The District of Columbia has chosen U.S. EPA’s free, industry-standard ENERGY STAR® Portfolio Manager® tool for benchmarking and reporting. DDOE is required to publicly disclose the ENERGY STAR® Benchmarking results for each publicly or privately owned building that is subject to the benchmarking law, beginning with the 2nd year of benchmarking data for that building.

This dataset consists of UTC metrics summarized by ward. The UTC Assessment is a top-down approach to analyzing the urban forest. Its purpose is to integrate high resolution land cover data with other GIS datasets to produce a set of detailed metrics on the urban forest that allow decision makers to know how much tree canopy currently exists (termed Existing UTC) and amount of land where is it biophysically feasible to establish tree canopy on (termed Possible UTC). Existing UTC is determined by extracting all features classified as tree canopy from a high resolution land cover dataset. Possible UTC is determined by identifying land where canopy could possibly exist and includes two subcategories: Possible-impervious and Possible-vegetation. Possible-impervious consists of all impervious land that, through modification, could support tree canopy. Examples of such features are sidewalks, minor driveways (through overhanging coverage), and playgrounds. Possible-vegetation consists of all land that is low-lying vegetation, primarily grass or shrubs, which could conceivably be converted to support tree canopy. Examples of such features include residential lawns and playing fields. Possible-vegetation also includes bare earth where no vegetation or impervious surfaces currently exist. UTC metrics do not serve to address the issues of where it is socially desirable or financially feasible to plant trees. Rather, the UTC metrics serve as the basis for beginning to form answers to these questions. UTC metrics are presented in the attribute table as both absolute area (in square meters) and relative area (percentage of land area) per parcel. For example, an Existing UTC Area (UTC_E_A) value of 13,677 and an Existing UTC Percentage (UTC_E_P) of 21.8 indicate that for the parcel in question the area of Existing UTC is 13,677 (in square meters) and 21.8% of that feature is tree canopy. Key ward attributes have been maintained to assist in joining this table to the original wards layer. The land cover dataset used to derive the UTC metrics for this dataset was generated from Quickbird color-infrared imagery acquired on September 7, 2006. The wards layer was current as of March 5, 2007.","keyword":["Open Data","Washington DC","DC GIS","District of Columbia","Environment","Environmental","Politics","council","Washington","boundary","Wards","DC","Land Cover","Urban","Imagery","Forest Opportunity Spectrum","UTC","Tree Canopy","Existing","FOS","September 7","2006","Possible"],"issued":"2015-02-27T20:55:45.000Z","modified":"2017-02-18T19:10:21.000Z","publisher":{"name":"City of Washington, DC"},"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"DC GIS Opendata","hasEmail":"mailto:gisgroup@dc.gov?subject= DC AGO Question or Comment"},"accessLevel":"public","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"ArcGIS Open Dataset","format":"Web page","mediaType":"text/html","accessURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/4919ca2fa0894de18e4752a5e16ca683_22"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Esri Rest API","format":"Esri REST","mediaType":"application/json","accessURL":"http://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/rest/services/DCGIS_DATA/Environment_WebMercator/MapServer/22"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"GeoJSON","format":"GeoJSON","mediaType":"application/vnd.geo+json","downloadURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/4919ca2fa0894de18e4752a5e16ca683_22.geojson"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"CSV","format":"CSV","mediaType":"text/csv","downloadURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/4919ca2fa0894de18e4752a5e16ca683_22.csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"KML","format":"KML","mediaType":"application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml","downloadURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/4919ca2fa0894de18e4752a5e16ca683_22.kml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Shapefile","format":"ZIP","mediaType":"application/zip","downloadURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/4919ca2fa0894de18e4752a5e16ca683_22.zip"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"OGC WMS","format":"OGC WMS","mediaType":"application/vnd.ogc.wms_xml","accessURL":"http://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/services/DCGIS_DATA/Environment_WebMercator/MapServer/WMSServer?request=GetCapabilities&service=WMS"}],"landingPage":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/4919ca2fa0894de18e4752a5e16ca683_22","webService":"http://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/rest/services/DCGIS_DATA/Environment_WebMercator/MapServer/22","license":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/4919ca2fa0894de18e4752a5e16ca683_22/license.json","spatial":"-77.1198964251,38.7915818465,-76.9090163369,38.9959674016","theme":["geospatial"]},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","identifier":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/b8e5fb96e36943f88bdcec7f6001e13c_31","title":"Combined Sewer Outfall Sewer Shed","description":"Combined Sewers Outfall (CSO) drainage areas.

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Face refers to the areal (polygon) topological primitives that make up MTDB. A face is bounded by one or more edges; its boundary includes only the edges that separate it from other faces, not any interior edges contained within the area of the face. The Topological Faces Shapefile contains the attributes of each topological primitive face. Each face has a unique topological face identifier (TFID) value. Each face in the shapefile includes the key geographic area codes for almost all geographic areas for which the Census Bureau tabulates data for both the 2010 Census and Census 2000. The geometries of each of these geographic areas can then be built by dissolving the face geometries on the appropriate key geographic area codes in the Topological Faces Shapefile.","keyword":["Open Data","Washington DC","DC GIS","District of Columbia","Demographic","People","Legislative Session Year","New England County Metropolitan Area FIPS Code","Tabulation Block Number","State Legislative District Lower Chamber Code","County or equivalent entity","Topological Faces","Table","United States","106th congressional district Code","State FIPS Code","Tribal Subdivision Code","Census Tract Number","5Percent Public Use Microdata Area Code","Alaska Native Regional Corporation FIPS code","County FIPS Code","Metropolitan Statistical AreaConsolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area FIPS Code","boundaries","Landwater Flag","Unified School District Local Education Agency Code","5 digit ZIP Code Tabulation Area Code","Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area FIPS Code","Elementary School District Local Education Agency Code","11001","State Legislative District Upper Chamber Code","FIPS 55 Place Code For All Places","108th congressional district Code","1Percent Public Use Microdata Area Code","Urban Growth Area Code","Rreservation or Offreservation Trust Land Indicator","Traffic Analysis Zone Code","Urban Area Code","Secondary School District Local Education Agency Code","Number","3 digit ZIP Code Tabulation Area Code","Voting District Code","County Subdivision FIPS Code","County or Equivalent Entity","Subminor Civil Division FIPS Code in Puerto Rico","US","Consolidated City FIPS Code","Block Group","American IndianAlaska NativeNative Hawaiian Areas Census Code","income"],"issued":"2015-02-27T20:47:51.000Z","modified":"2017-02-08T20:46:08.000Z","publisher":{"name":"City of Washington, DC"},"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"DC GIS Opendata","hasEmail":"mailto:gisgroup@dc.gov?subject= DC AGO Question or Comment"},"accessLevel":"public","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"ArcGIS Open Dataset","format":"Web page","mediaType":"text/html","accessURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/6969dd63c5cb4d6aa32f15effb8311f3_8"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Esri Rest API","format":"Esri REST","mediaType":"application/json","accessURL":"http://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/rest/services/DCGIS_DATA/Demographic_WebMercator/MapServer/8"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"GeoJSON","format":"GeoJSON","mediaType":"application/vnd.geo+json","downloadURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/6969dd63c5cb4d6aa32f15effb8311f3_8.geojson"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"CSV","format":"CSV","mediaType":"text/csv","downloadURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/6969dd63c5cb4d6aa32f15effb8311f3_8.csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"KML","format":"KML","mediaType":"application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml","downloadURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/6969dd63c5cb4d6aa32f15effb8311f3_8.kml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Shapefile","format":"ZIP","mediaType":"application/zip","downloadURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/6969dd63c5cb4d6aa32f15effb8311f3_8.zip"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"OGC WMS","format":"OGC WMS","mediaType":"application/vnd.ogc.wms_xml","accessURL":"http://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/services/DCGIS_DATA/Demographic_WebMercator/MapServer/WMSServer?request=GetCapabilities&service=WMS"}],"landingPage":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/6969dd63c5cb4d6aa32f15effb8311f3_8","webService":"http://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/rest/services/DCGIS_DATA/Demographic_WebMercator/MapServer/8","license":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/6969dd63c5cb4d6aa32f15effb8311f3_8/license.json","spatial":"-77.1198622286,38.7915902889,-76.9092620946,38.9958093307","theme":["geospatial"]},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","identifier":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/04acab0adbe542cdba6d7a443a4aec21_16","title":"2013 Community Arts Grant 2","description":"<p>The Community Arts Grant (CAG) provides support for small-scale projects to promote arts and humanities activities to a diverse range of communities in the District of Columbia.

This dataset is a consolidated collection of all known DC Reservations. The primary data source for this dataset is the Reservations List, The Parks of the National Park System, Washington DC, published by the National Park Service (NPS) in August 2002. Spatial data came from a variety of sources, including the Park Service (NPS), DC Parks and Recreation (DPR), the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO), and the Office of Tax and Revenue (OTR).

The day boundaries are the areas where trash collection takes place on a particular day. There are several routes within each day boundary. Each crew is assigned to collect trash in one route per day. Conventional trash collection refers to the type of trash container used by the residents for setting out trash. The smaller carts that are distributed by the City fit better in the more crowded areas of the central part of the City due to small or non-existent yards and tight alleys. Since the containers are smaller, trash in the conventional area of the City is collected twice a week. Therefore the Day boundaries are designated as Monday/Thursday or as Tuesday/Friday. <a href=\"http://geospatial.dcgis.dc.gov/dc_kmz/metadata/ConvTrashDay.html\" target=\"_blank\">&lt;Metadata&gt;</a><p></p>","keyword":["Open Data","Washington DC","DC GIS","District of Columbia","Public","Service","Public Service"],"issued":"2015-02-27T21:13:04.000Z","modified":"2017-02-02T15:33:59.000Z","publisher":{"name":"City of Washington, DC"},"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"DC GIS Opendata","hasEmail":"mailto:gisgroup@dc.gov?subject= DC AGO Question or Comment"},"accessLevel":"public","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"ArcGIS Open Dataset","format":"Web page","mediaType":"text/html","accessURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/50828cf6f54a41728408a9fd31969820_13"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Esri Rest API","format":"Esri REST","mediaType":"application/json","accessURL":"http://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/rest/services/DCGIS_DATA/Public_Service_WebMercator/MapServer/13"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"GeoJSON","format":"GeoJSON","mediaType":"application/vnd.geo+json","downloadURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/50828cf6f54a41728408a9fd31969820_13.geojson"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"CSV","format":"CSV","mediaType":"text/csv","downloadURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/50828cf6f54a41728408a9fd31969820_13.csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"KML","format":"KML","mediaType":"application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml","downloadURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/50828cf6f54a41728408a9fd31969820_13.kml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Shapefile","format":"ZIP","mediaType":"application/zip","downloadURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/50828cf6f54a41728408a9fd31969820_13.zip"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"OGC WMS","format":"OGC WMS","mediaType":"application/vnd.ogc.wms_xml","accessURL":"http://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/services/DCGIS_DATA/Public_Service_WebMercator/MapServer/WMSServer?request=GetCapabilities&service=WMS"}],"landingPage":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/50828cf6f54a41728408a9fd31969820_13","webService":"http://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/rest/services/DCGIS_DATA/Public_Service_WebMercator/MapServer/13","license":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/50828cf6f54a41728408a9fd31969820_13/license.json","spatial":"-77.0730264714,38.8707210355,-76.9754594416,38.9374327416","theme":["geospatial"]},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","identifier":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/d6c70978daa8461992658b69dccb3dbf_24","title":"Computer Assisted Mass Appraisal - Condominium","description":"Computer Assisted Mass Appraisal (CAMA) database.

It includes\r\nstructures originally captured from 2005 aerial imagery together with updates\r\nbased on 2010 aerial imagery. It was produced under contract to the District of\r\nColumbia by CyberCity3D, Inc. using stereo imagery and a proprietary extraction\r\nprocess that identifies roof polygon points and then creates entire structures\r\nfrom them to form roof polygons.Attributes containing roof height, slope and\r\norientation are included. This dataset is an update to a previous 3D dataset\r\nproduced in 2006 using 2005 imagery. It specifically includes updates to\r\nbuilding rooftops identified in the course of the District of Columbia’s\r\nseparate planimetric update effort, which noted structures known that were\r\nadded, modified between or deleted between 2008 and 2010. Although it was\r\nintended to capture all new buildings irrespective of whether or not they were\r\nidentified through the planimetric update process, it is likely that building\r\nrooftop changes not identified through the planimetric update process may not\r\nhave been captured. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This dataset contains\r\nrooftops, including protrusions such as gabled windows, chimneys, elevator\r\nutility rooms, etc.. There were also additional datasets delivered which broke\r\nout those roof elements into separate files, as well as deliveries which included\r\ncomplete 3D buildings with rooftops and facades. In many instances, row-houses\r\nand other contiguous building rooftops could not be broken apart using the\r\nprocess methodology and appear as a single structure. In some cases, entire\r\nblocks of row houses are represented as a single feature, though visually they\r\ncan be distinguished easily. Additionally, the process captured small features,\r\nsuch as canopy umbrellas and other structures as building rooftops and these\r\nfeatures may exist at various locations in the dataset.Many data gaps in the\r\nearlier dataset (largely due to missing or reduced-resolution source imagery)\r\nare corrected in this product. Based on comparison to DC’s available\r\nplanimetric datasets, there are still instances where particular structures are\r\nomitted or not updated in the current product, but we believe that upwards of\r\n99% of the District’s buildings are reflected in this dataset.All DC GIS data\r\nis stored and exported in Maryland State Plane coordinates NAD 83 meters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://geospatial.dcgis.dc.gov/dc_kmz/metadata/BldgPly_3D_roof.xml\" target=\"_blank\">XML Metadata</a></p>","keyword":["dc gis","dc","washington dc","facility","buildings","structure","3d","3d roof"],"issued":"2016-03-16T12:44:02.000Z","modified":"2017-02-02T15:33:54.000Z","publisher":{"name":"City of Washington, DC"},"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"DC GIS Opendata","hasEmail":"mailto:gisgroup@dc.gov?subject= DC AGO Question or Comment"},"accessLevel":"public","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","format":"Web Page","mediaType":"text/html","accessURL":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1Wt8FRXoFfJdmVOamRCQmgtZEk"}],"landingPage":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/274f7c2b5f7c4ae19f165d9951057a00","webService":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1Wt8FRXoFfJdmVOamRCQmgtZEk","license":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/274f7c2b5f7c4ae19f165d9951057a00/license.json","spatial":"-180.0,-90.0,180.0,90.0"},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","identifier":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/28dacaf5dcf2426aabc18e463dfe9b2c_22","title":"Bulk Collection - Last 30 Days","description":"This data layer shows 311 Service Requests in the last 30 days for bulk collections.

For analysis purposes, RPTA delineates assessment neighborhoods to group properties that are affected by similar economic, political, governmental, and environmental factors. Assessment subneighborhoods are defined by the environment of a subject property that has a direct and immediate effect on its value. The assessment subneighborhood is a geographic area (in which there are typically fewer than several thousand properties) defined for some useful purpose, such as to ensure for later multiple regression modeling that the properties are homogeneous and share important locational characteristics. Assessment neighborhoods boundaries typically follow street centerlines, hydrological boundaries, and boundaries of major properties such as parks and monuments. The current feature class was created by selecting coincident features from the DC GIS snapbase. These included road centerlines, stream centerlines, water boundaries, rail lines, and DC political boundaries. After a new feature class was created, any additional lines required for polygon closure were snapped to existing features using a tolerance of .001 meters.","keyword":["Washington","DC","District of Columbia","DC GIS","RPTA neighborhoods","Assessment sub neighborhoods","Assessment neighborhoods","DCGIS"],"issued":"2015-02-27T21:09:49.000Z","modified":"2017-02-02T15:33:41.000Z","publisher":{"name":"City of Washington, DC"},"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"DC GIS Opendata","hasEmail":"mailto:gisgroup@dc.gov?subject= DC AGO Question or Comment"},"accessLevel":"public","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"ArcGIS Open Dataset","format":"Web page","mediaType":"text/html","accessURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/edfec5a1434848dc9faab79dd55c1e64_7"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Esri Rest API","format":"Esri REST","mediaType":"application/json","accessURL":"http://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/rest/services/DCGIS_DATA/Property_and_Land_WebMercator/MapServer/7"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"GeoJSON","format":"GeoJSON","mediaType":"application/vnd.geo+json","downloadURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/edfec5a1434848dc9faab79dd55c1e64_7.geojson"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"CSV","format":"CSV","mediaType":"text/csv","downloadURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/edfec5a1434848dc9faab79dd55c1e64_7.csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"KML","format":"KML","mediaType":"application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml","downloadURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/edfec5a1434848dc9faab79dd55c1e64_7.kml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"Shapefile","format":"ZIP","mediaType":"application/zip","downloadURL":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/edfec5a1434848dc9faab79dd55c1e64_7.zip"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"OGC WMS","format":"OGC WMS","mediaType":"application/vnd.ogc.wms_xml","accessURL":"http://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/services/DCGIS_DATA/Property_and_Land_WebMercator/MapServer/WMSServer?request=GetCapabilities&service=WMS"}],"landingPage":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/edfec5a1434848dc9faab79dd55c1e64_7","webService":"http://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/rest/services/DCGIS_DATA/Property_and_Land_WebMercator/MapServer/7","license":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/edfec5a1434848dc9faab79dd55c1e64_7/license.json","spatial":"-77.1143780965,38.8190625498,-76.9090306698,38.9847732857","theme":["geospatial"]},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","identifier":"http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/6aa6d6b7414944ccad4e6758074a3125_1","title":"Capital Projects - 2010","description":"<div>The dataset contains locations and attributes of Capital Projects 2010, created as part of the DC Geographic Information System (DC GIS) for the D.C.

at their disposal significant discretionary income for arts and cultural offerings.   Further, according to the 2012 Arts and Economic Prosperity IV Study conducted by Americans for the Arts, $1.1 billion in economic activity is generated annually by the non-profit arts and culture industry in Washington, DC.  Additionally, the culture industry returns $80 million in local tax revenue to the District’s coffers.  These trends create an opportunity for DCCAH to position itself at the forefront of the city’s cultural planning.   To achieve this goal, DCCAH will endeavor in a cultural planning process to understand the strategic opportunities that will be central to accomplishing this broad vision.<br /></p>","keyword":["Open Data","Washington DC","DC GIS","District of

THERE ARE VISIBLE LEAF-ON AND LEAF-OFF SEAM LINES IN THE AERIAL ORTHOPHOTO. The project area covers the entire District of Columbia which is approximately 69 square miles. The digital imagery was used to create natural color digital orthophotography with 16cm pixel resolution. The final orthophotography deliverable products for this project consist of 328 ortho tiles at a scale of 1 to 2400. The tile dimensions are 800 meters by 800 meters. A corresponding MrSid image was created by mosaicking the 328 ortho tiles together and compressing the image using an 80 to 1 compression ration.

Benchmarking is defined as tracking a building’s energy and water use and using a standard metric to compare the building’s performance against past performance and to its peers nationwide. These comparisons have been shown to drive energy efficiency upgrades and increase occupancy rates and property values. DC has chosen U.S. EPA’s free, industry-standard ENERGY STAR® Portfolio Manager® tool for benchmarking and reporting. DDOE is required to publicly disclose the ENERGY STAR® Benchmarking results for each privately owned building that is subject to the benchmarking law, beginning with the 2nd year of benchmarking data for that building.
