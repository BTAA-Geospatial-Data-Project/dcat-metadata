Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.Maryland, through its Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program, is collecting information on how the public uses the Chesapeake Bay waters and adjacent lands. These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to help inform public access, land acquisition, and future oyster aquaculture planning and decision-making. Collecting data on the variety of ways our Chesapeake waters are used will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. Chesapeake Bay waters are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, transport, habitat for wildlife, and recreation, among others. With new and expanding coastal and marine uses, as well as Maryland?s growing coastal population, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized. Some mapped human use data exist, but Maryland has limited recreational water use data for the Chesapeake waters. Basic data on how we use our coastal waters was collected by inviting residents and experts to share their knowledge about recreational uses at workshops using geographical information systems technology.Last Updated: 07/01/2014Feature Service Layer Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Society/MD_RecreationalUses/FeatureServer/45",2016-04-06T16:53:31.000Z,2017-06-01T19:36:38.000Z,http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/defc0fb98c774ed299c97906823736c5_45,http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Society/MD_RecreationalUses/FeatureServer/45,"-77.3819,38.0086,-75.0755,38.8679",http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/defc0fb98c774ed299c97906823736c5_45

This file was derived from a more detailed watershed file (Maryland's Third-Order Watershed). The process used to create this file is consistent with the elevation contour information found on the US Geological Survey's 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle maps and the Maryland Department of the Environment's watershed location and naming conventions. This file is similar, but not identical, to the US Natural Resources Conservation Service's (NRCS) Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC11) watershed file. The watersheds define Strahler (Strahler 1952 p.1120) third order stream drainage by contours on U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5 minute quadrangle map sheets.

Find more information on?http://imap.maryland.gov.In the Chesapeake Bay relative sea level rise is impacting coastal lands at twice the global average rate. Identifying long-term planning options to increase resiliency against coastal storm surge, flooding, and erosion is an important step in protecting Maryland's coastal zone. Much of our natural buffering capacity against these coastal hazards, come from our coastal wetlands. In order to better understand the impacts sea level rise may have on the State's coastal marsh system, the Sea-Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) was run for all 16 coastal counties and Baltimore City. The results of SLAMM were analyzed for specific conservation criteria for long-term planning that may help increase coastal resiliency in Maryland. The conservation criteria included areas that may support future wetland migration, wildlife habitat, wildlife corridors, high priority aquatic and terrestrial living resources, vulnerable wetland habitat, suitable hydric soils for wetland establishment and marsh-dependent breeding bird habitat. From these criteria a conservation model was developed to prioritize the most important areas for wetland adaptation. As a result the top priorities were used to create the Wetland Adaptation Areas for the Targeted Ecological Areas (TEAs) used in Marylands GreenPrint.The Department of Natural Resources makes no warranty, expressed or implied, as to the use or appropriateness of Spatial Data, and there are no warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose or use.

Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy. In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas.

The vector format was created from the SHA Shoreline file and graphic representations in the Lippson book (See bibliography below). These areas were then overlane with a point file created from lat/long collected during the surveys conducted by O'dell, Mowrer, and Uphoff of MD DNR Fisheries Service. This was done to verify that the graphic representations were accurate. These data sets were then converted to raster format and reclassified with a rank determined by DNR biologists. This rank determines level of habitat importance with spawning areas ranking highest and adult areas of bay depth below 3 feet ranking the lowest. These ranked rasters were then stacked and an output raster was created showing areas of high habitat diversity. These rasters were then clipped by county.

Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.The service depicts the number of broadband service providers per census block and the layer represents the National Telecommunications Information Administration (NTIA) State Broadband Data Development Program (SBDD) area of broadband availability. The number of broadband providers per census block is illustrated. Area of broadband availability refers to those individual US Census Blocks, less than 2 square miles, where each facilities-based provider of broadband service can provide broadband services of minimal characteristics within 7 - 10 business days. For this purpose, 'broadband service' is the provision, on either a commercial or non-commercial basis, of data transmission technology that provides two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end users, or providing sufficient capacity in a middle mile project to support the provision of broadband service to end-users within the project area. For this purpose, an 'end user' of broadband service is a residential or business party, institution or State or local government entity that may use broadband service for its own purposes and that does not resell such service to other entities or incorporate such service into retail Internet-access services. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are not 'end users' for this purpose. An entity is a 'facilities based' provider of broadband service connections to end user locations if any of the following conditions are met: (1) It owns the portion of the physical facility that terminates at the end user location; (2) it obtains unbundled network elements (UNEs), special access lines, or other leased facilities that terminate at the end user location and provisions/equips them as broadband; or (3) it provisions/equips a broadband wireless channel to the end user location over licensed or unlicensed spectrum. For this purpose, 'broadband service' is 'available' at an address if the provider does, or could, within a typical service interval (7 to 10 business days) without an extraordinary commitment of resources, provision two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end-users at that address.
