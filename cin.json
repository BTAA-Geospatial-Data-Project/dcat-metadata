In October 2016, GCWW was directed by the City of Cincinnati Council, via Ordinance No. 326-2016, to take the appropriate steps to develop, fund, and implement a program to replace known lead service lines in the City, both on public and private property. Through another ordinance, Ordinance No. 185-2017, and effective July 28, 2017, lead service lines are prohibited in the GCWW system. Enforcement of this ban is being phased in over time. \r\n\r\nThe private-side work is then done by contractors or plumbers who are contracted with GCWW through the City's procurement process, either for a water main replacement project, or from a prequalified list established through the City's Request for Qualifications (RFQ) process. \r\n\r\nThis dataset is the list of jobs from the prequalified list of plumbers established through the RFQ process. \r\n\r\nFor more information on the GCWW Lead Service Line Replacement Program please visit the GCWW Lead Awareness site https://lead.mygcww.org.
