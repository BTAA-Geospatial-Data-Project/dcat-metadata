This dataset contains the updated urban area boundaries for the 2010 Census update cycle (recently updated in the Winter of 2017)NJDOT has revised the New Jersey urban area based upon the 2010 U.S. Census urban area boundaries. The U.S. Census defines an Urban Area as any area with a population = 2,500. Under the Urban Area definition, Urban Clusters are 2,500-49,999 and Urbanized Areas are = 50,000. FHWA, however, defines urban areas slightly different. Under FHWA, an Urban Area is = 5,000, with Small Urban Areas 5,000-49,999 and Urbanized Areas = 50,000. NJDOT followed the FHWA urban area definitions for this urban area update. To perform this update, NJDOT first combined the 2000 NJDOT urban area with the 2010 US Census urban areas greater than 5,000 in population. Since census urban area boundaries are based upon census block boundaries, which can be irregular, NJDOT extended outward the urban area (smoothed) to the nearest road, stream, political boundary, or manmade feature using the 2012 NJ orthophotos as a base map. Where there was no obvious boundary to smooth to, the census boundary was retained. NJDOT also expanded the urban area to include any densely developed areas not included in the 2000 NJDOT urban area or 2010 Census urban areas.The urban area update went through a thorough public review and comment period. Representatives from NJDOT, all 21 counties, and the 3 metropolitan planning and organizations (NJTPA, SJTPO, and DVRPC) met during various phases of the project to review the updated urban area.

Ohio Geographically Referenced Information Program,"[u'OHIO', u'OEMA', u'SWPA1', u'OEPA', u'SURFACE WATER']",http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/31a2127a3f724f16a290965a1ddad3ae_0,SURFACE WATER PROTECTION AREA 1 YEAR TRAVEL TIME,"
The Ohio Source Water Protection Program is intended to protect Ohio's streams, rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and ground waters used for public drinking water from future contamination.  To protect drinking water supplies,  a protection area is delineated based on the area that supplies water to the well or surface water intake. 

The data set swpa_1_active contains source water protection areas at active public water systems and only those source water protection areas that were active at the time of the data export. Inactive source water protection areas (e.g. wells have been deactivated) or proposed source water protection areas (e.g. for wells under development) are not included.

A Drinking Water Source Water Protection Area for a public water system using ground water is the surface and subsurface area surrounding a public water supply well(s) which will provide water from an aquifer to the well(s) within five years as delineated or endorsed by the agency under Ohio's Wellhead Protection and Source Water Assessment and Protection Programs. 

The Inner Management Zone is the surface and subsurface area surrounding a public water supply well(s) that will provide water to the well(s) within one year as delineated or endorsed by the agency under the wellhead protection program and the source water assessment and protection program.

Several types of source water protection areas have been defined for surface water supplied water systems.  The definiton and the method of delineation are based on the type of water body from which the system withdrawls water. The waterbody types are 1) interior lakes, rivers or streams, 2) the Ohio River or 3) Lake Erie. All of these areas are delineated or endorsed by Ohio EPA under Ohio's Source Water Assessment and Protection Program.

For systems with intakes on interior lakes, rivers and streams, three types of areas are defined: 1) the Drinking Water Source Protection Area (DWSPA)- the drainage area upstream of the point where a public water system withdraws water from a surface source; 2) the Corridor Managment Zone (CMZ) - the surface and subsurface area where the potential for drinking water contamination warrants delineation, inventory, and management because of its proximity to a public water system intake; and 3) the Emergency Management Zone - the surface and subsurface area in the immediate vicinity of a public water system intake.

For systems with intakes on Lake Erie, a Critical Area Zone (CAZ) is delineated. The size of the CAZ is based upon the sensitivity of the intake to contamination which is determined by its depth and distance from shore. The shape and extent of this area may be modified to take into account site specific conditions.  Contaminants within this zone can quickly impact water quality at the intake. A Potential Influence Zone (PIZ) may also be delineated. The PIZ is the area along the lake shore and any contributing tributaries up to the point of known contaminant sources and the length of shoreline where pollutants may become a threat to the intake.

Public water systems with intakes on the Ohio River have three zones defined.
Zone 1, or the Zone of Critical Concern, extends one quarter mile below a water intake to 25 miles upstream in the Ohio River. Zone 2, the Zone of High Concern extends one quarter mile below a surface water intake, upstream, to one quarter mile below the next Ohio River intake. Major tributaries are incorporated within a 25 mile distance upstream from the intake. Zone 3 is the Source Water Area, or the entire portion of the Ohio River Basin upstream from the surface water
intake.

The Ohio Source Water Protection Program is intended to protect Ohio's streams, rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and ground waters used for public drinking water from future contamination.  To protect drinking water supplies,  a protection area is delineated based on the area that supplies water to the well or surface water intake. 

A Drinking Water Source Water Protection Area for a public water system using ground water is the surface and subsurface area surrounding a public water supply well(s) which will provide water from an aquifer to the well(s) within five years as delineated or endorsed by the agency under Ohio's Wellhead Protection and Source Water Assessment and Protection Programs. 

The Inner Management Zone is the surface and subsurface area surrounding a public water supply well(s) that will provide water to the well(s) within one year as delineated or endorsed by the agency under the wellhead protection program and the source water assessment and protection program.

Several types of source water protection areas have been defined for surface water supplied water systems.  The definiton and the method of delineation are based on the type of water body from which the system withdrawls water. The waterbody types are 1) interior lakes, rivers or streams, 2) the Ohio River or 3) Lake Erie. All of these areas are delineated or endorsed by Ohio EPA under Ohio's Source Water Assessment and Protection Program.

For systems with intakes on interior lakes, rivers and streams, three types of areas are defined: 1) the Drinking Water Source Protection Area (DWSPA)- the drainage area upstream of the point where a public water system withdraws water from a surface source; 2) the Corridor Managment Zone (CMZ) - the surface and subsurface area where the potential for drinking water contamination warrants delineation, inventory, and management because of its proximity to a public water system intake; and 3) the Emergency Management Zone - the surface and subsurface area in the immediate vicinity of a public water system intake.

For systems with intakes on Lake Erie, a Critical Area Zone (CAZ) is delineated. The size of the CAZ is based upon the sensitivity of the intake to contamination which is determined by its depth and distance from shore. The shape and extent of this area may be modified to take into account site specific conditions.  Contaminants within this zone can quickly impact water quality at the intake. A Potential Influence Zone (PIZ) may also be delineated. The PIZ is the area along the lake shore and any contributing tributaries up to the point of known contaminant sources and the length of shoreline where pollutants may become a threat to the intake.

Public water systems with intakes on the Ohio River have three zones defined.
Zone 1, or the Zone of Critical Concern, extends one quarter mile below a water intake to 25 miles upstream in the Ohio River. Zone 2, the Zone of High Concern extends one quarter mile below a surface water intake, upstream, to one quarter mile below the next Ohio River intake. Major tributaries are incorporated within a 25 mile distance upstream from the intake. Zone 3 is the Source Water Area, or the entire portion of the Ohio River Basin upstream from the surface water
intake.

County Division of Transportation, the Lake County Forest Preserve 
District, the municipalities of Gurnee, Highland Park, Lake Forest, 
Libertyville, Lincolnshire, Vernon Hills, and Waukegan among others, and
 the GIS Division of the Lake County Department of Information 
Technology.

Note that the trails in this theme are actually constructed, open, 
in-use trails. This theme does not include any future trail plans or 
trails under new construction. In addition, trail loops not greater than
 around 1000 ft were not included (i.e. to avoid isolated playgrounds).

All the geometry has been verified to match the 2014 aerials as much as 
possible but some areas have been drawn with older aerials when the 2014
 tree cover was too dense. Therefore the spatial reference is now in 
NAD83(NSRS2007) vs HARN to match the 2014 aerials. The intended usage 
scale for this theme is 1 = 100' or a scale ratio of 1:1200. This 
specification derives from the scale of the orthophotography used as a 
reference for the trail line features, for trails not mapped through 
field GPS data gathering.

The bike, horse, snowmobile, and walking usage types were chosen since 
we have the most complete information on them. They are blank when 
information is not available.

The surface types are photo interpreted and have not been field 
verified.Update Frequency:This dataset is updated on a weekly basis.",2016-11-23T20:14:37.000Z,2018-10-17T21:39:39.938Z,http://data-lakecountyil.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/cc4e1c09e911416788832092a2ea79e9_2,https://services3.arcgis.com/HESxeTbDliKKvec2/arcgis/rest/services/LakeCounty_Transportation/FeatureServer/2,"-88.2017,42.1493,-87.7655,42.5005",http://data-lakecountyil.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/cc4e1c09e911416788832092a2ea79e9_2

Part 404(b)(1) of the Clean Water Act authorizes the USEPA and the US Army Corps of Engineers
 to identify in advance of specific permit requests aquatic sites which 
will be considered as areas generally unsuitable for disposal of dredged
 or fill material. This process is called an Advanced Identification or 
ADID. Under the ADID process identification of an area as generally 
unsuitable for fill does not prohibit applications for permits to fill 
in these areas. Therefore the ADID designation of unsuitability is 
advisory not regulatory.

        An ADID designation lets a potential applicant know in 
advance that a proposal to fill such a site is not likely to be 
consistent with the 404(b)(1) guidelines, and the USEPA will probably 
request permit denial.

        ADID wetland information is also useful in watershed 
planning, land use planning, public land acquisition programs, natural 
resource studies and other purposes.

        The wetland selection criteria and methodology are documented
 in the publication entitled Advanced Identification (ADID) Study, Lake
 County, Illinois. Final Report, November 1992 which is included in

These data were developed from LIDAR data obtained between April 16, 2007 and May 07, 2007, and further supplemented by break lines collected from aerial photography taken at the same time. The contours and the aerial photography meet National Map Accuracy Standards for a 1 inch = 100 foot product. The contours have been created to be cartographically pleasing, as such some generalization has been introduced as expected. The contours have been tested against the original LIDAR points and conforms to the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) Specifications and Standards Committee, 1990, ASPRS Accuracy Standards for Large-Scale Maps, CLASS 1 map accuracy. The vertical datum is the North American Vertical Datum of 1988.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers?Engineering and Design Manual for Photogrammetric Production?recommends that data intended for this usage scale be used for any of the following purposes: route location, preliminary alignment and design, preliminary project planning, hydraulic sections, rough earthwork estimates, or high-gradient terrain / low unit cost earthwork excavation estimates. The manual does not recommend that these data be used for final design, excavation and grading plans, earthwork computations for bid estimates or contract measurement and payment.Contour data is used by county agencies to study drainage issues such as flooding and erosion.

north, west and south boundaries are based on a compilation of survey data
which aligns well, but not perfectly, with the border as mapped by neighboring
counties and the State of Wisconsin, which forms the northern boundary of the

legal documents going back to the mid 1800's, following generally accepted
practices used in Public Land Survey System states, and following guidelines
established by the Illinois Department of Revenue and the International
Association of Assessment Officials. Lake County's parcel coverage is based on
resolving the accumulated evidence of all of the legal documents surrounding a
particular parcel or subdivision, and not the result of a countywide resurvey.
These parcel boundaries are intended to be a visual inventory of property for
tax and other administrative purposes; they are not intended to be used in
place of an on-site survey or for the precise determination of property corners
or PLSS features based on GIS coordinates. In Illinois, only a registered
professional land surveyor is authorized to determine boundary locations.

Included are the tax parcel boundaries, represented as polygons and
centroids, for all changes resulting from legal records submitted to the
Recorder of Deeds up to December 31st of the preceding year, as well as any
court orders, municipal annexations and other transactions which impact the tax
parcel boundaries. NOTE: The ONLY attribute included is the Property
Index Number, or PARCEL_NUM. Additional assessment attribute data can be
downloaded here.

This parcel layer is used for tax assessment purposes and for a variety of
other local government functions. It changes often, both spatially and in its

developed for a myriad of uses including E-911, as a cartographic base, and for
use in spatial analysis. 

This coverage should include all
public and selected private roads within Lake County, Illinois. Roads are
initially entered using recorded documents and then later adjusted using
current aerial photography. This dataset should satisfy National Map Accuracy
Standards for a 1:1200 product.

These centerlines have been provided
to the United States
Census Bureau and were used to conflate the TIGER
road features for Lake County. The Census Bureau evaluated these centerlines
and, based on field survey of 109 intersections, determined that there is a 95%
confidence level that the coordinate positions in the centerline dataset fall
within 1.9 meters of their true ground position.

The fields PRE_DIR, ST_NAME, ST_TYPE

wetlands meeting definitions established by the federal agencies who 
work with the Lake County Geographic Information System staff to 
periodically review and update it. These agencies include the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service and the United States Army Corps of Engineers.

        The 1989 federal wetland delineation standards for offsite 
wetland mapping are used. This data was last published in March of 1993.
 This update includes changes to the previous version of LCWI including:
 adjust current wetland boundaries to omit development, including roads;
 to fine tune boundary placement where that was intended by the original
 delineation, in some cases, adjust the wetland to photographic features
 / signature; delete wetlands which the committee decided were mapped in
 error - for example, trees which were mistaken for wet areas; create 
polygons for newly delineated artificial wetlands; and newly delineated 
wetlands or farmed wetlands caused by the continued deterioration of the
 agricultural drain tile system and increased runoff due to 
urbanization.

        The LCWI is a useful tool for general planning and review 
purposes, but it does not take the place of an on-site delineation by a 
certified wetland specialist.

        High resolution (1 = 100') orthorectified aerial imagery 
captured in April 2002 was used as the base for this update. Other data 
used as reference for this update include: 2004 SOIL SURVEY GEOGRAPHIC 
(SSURGO) DATABASE FOR LAKE COUNTY, IL - U.S. Department of Agriculture, 
Natural Resources Conservation Service; HYDROLOGY2002 - Lake County 
GIS/Map Division; 2' topography (CONTOURS) - Lake County GIS/Map 
Division; and various years of historical aerial photography for 
clarification. By using the more recent higher resolution photography, 
the resulting updated wetland boundaries are more accurate then the 
original boundaries published in 1993.",2016-09-30T20:07:15.000Z,2018-10-17T21:39:42.416Z,http://data-lakecountyil.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/d59b21f762c648869d4df3b3cb4d6ad4_0,https://services3.arcgis.com/HESxeTbDliKKvec2/arcgis/rest/services/Lake_County_Wetland_Inventory/FeatureServer/0,"-88.19982978057534,42.152363629031214,-87.7558913142488,42.495831319293764",http://data-lakecountyil.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/d59b21f762c648869d4df3b3cb4d6ad4_0

The Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) currently reports this data only on the inventory direction (generally North or East) side of the roadway. Roadway Functional Classification data is not a complete representation of all roadway geometry.Maryland's roadway system is a vast network that connects places and people within and across county borders. Planners and engineers have developed elements of this network with particular travel objectives in mind. These objectives range from serving long-distance passenger and freight needs to serving neighborhood travel from residential developments to nearby shopping centers. The functional classification of roadways defines the role each element of the roadway network plays in serving these travel needs. ? Over the years, functional classification has come to assume additional significance beyond its purpose as a framework for identifying the particular role of a roadway in moving vehicles through a network of highways. Functional classification carries with it expectations about roadway design, including its speed, capacity and relationship to existing and future land use development. Federal legislation continues to use functional classification in determining eligibility for funding under the Federal-aid program. Transportation agencies describe roadway system performance, benchmarks and targets by functional classification. As agencies continue to move towards a more performance-based management approach, functional classification will be an increasingly important consideration in setting expectations and measuring outcomes for preservation, mobility and safety.Roadway Functional Classification data is developed as part of the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) which maintains and reports transportation related information to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on an annual basis.

To develop this list, all crashes in Iowa are used to determine an initial cut of intersections that meet the criteria of at least one crash. The intersections identified are then ranked according to the number of crashes, the severity of the crashes, and the rate at which crashes occur. To read more details regarding Iowa's SICL, see Iowa SICL method. The Iowa DOT utilizes crash reports filed by city police departments, county sheriffs, the Iowa State Patrol and individual drivers in determining the listings. The locations identified are eligible for funding assistance to develop safety improvements under the Iowa Traffic Safety Fund Program. Grant applications for funding are competitive and subject to comparison with the 5 percent severe safety needs list. The Iowa DOT will select proposals that provide the greatest safety return on the dollars invested. Proposals must be submitted to the Iowa DOT by June 15th each year to qualify for funding the following year.

Many of these lots were developed during the 1980s, primarily in response to a growing demand that resulted from an increase in fuel prices. In most cases, lot development was truly the result of grassroots efforts, with Iowa DOT?s district offices often responding to specific public requests for park and ride facilities.?In 2014, The Iowa Park and Ride System Plan was developed. This plan includes an update of the existing inventory, an identification of additional locations suitable for park and ride facilities, and strategies for implementation .The plan will be used by the Iowa DOT to plan, evaluate, and develop a formal state-owned-and-operated system of park and ride facilities. The primary objective of the plan is to provide a location-specific, priority-based park and ride system that allows for coordinated planning and implementation of park and ride facilities.As a part of the plan this database was created to geographically reference both existing state-owned park and ride facilities and ideal candidates for future expansion of the system.? This database will also be used in coordination with the statewide rideshare program, so it will also include other existing park and ride facilities not owned by the state or identified in the plan.?Ultimately this inventory has two main purposes that can be described generally as internal and external. Internally, the database will be used to keep track of state-owned inventory and identify opportunities for the expansion of the state-owned and operated park and ride system. Externally, the database will be expanded to include a wide array of park and ride facilities across the state of Iowa that can be disseminated to the public via the? Iowa DOT website and coordinated with the rideshare program.?",2018-09-28T15:49:32.000Z,2018-09-28T16:17:23.386Z,http://public-iowadot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/be367700638645bea11d09262931acb0_0,https://services.arcgis.com/8lRhdTsQyJpO52F1/arcgis/rest/services/Park_and_Ride_View/FeatureServer/0,"-96.947,40.259,-89.981,43.751",http://public-iowadot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/be367700638645bea11d09262931acb0_0

Features were created using a 2-mile buffer around each lot to represent primary routes that could potentially be viable (re)locations for park and ride lots. 2-miles was selected for the buffer area based on the FHWA report Safety Assessment of Interchange Spacing on Urban Freeways publication number FHWA-HRT-07-031. https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/safety/07031/The Iowa Department of Transportation?s park and ride system consists of state-owned park and ride lots. Many of these lots were developed during the 1980s, primarily in response to a growing demand that resulted from an increase in fuel prices. In most cases, lot development was truly the result of grassroots efforts, with Iowa DOT?s district offices often responding to specific public requests for park and ride facilities. In 2014, The Iowa Park and Ride System Plan was developed. This plan includes an update of the existing inventory, an identification of additional locations suitable for park and ride facilities, and strategies for implementation .The plan will be used by the Iowa DOT to plan, evaluate, and develop a formal state-owned-and-operated system of park and ride facilities. The primary objective of the plan is to provide a location-specific, priority-based park and ride system that allows for coordinated planning and implementation of park and ride facilities. As a part of the plan this database was created to geographically reference both existing state-owned park and ride facilities and ideal candidates for future expansion of the system. This database will also be used in coordination with the statewide rideshare program, so it will also include other existing park and ride facilities not owned by the state or identified in the plan. Ultimately this inventory has two main purposes that can be described generally as internal and external. Internally, the database will be used to keep track of state-owned inventory and identify opportunities for the expansion of the state-owned and operated park and ride system. Externally, the database will be expanded to include a wide array of park and ride facilities across the state of Iowa that can be disseminated to the public via the Iowa DOT website and coordinated with the rideshare program.",2018-10-16T14:14:40.000Z,2018-10-16T14:14:44.703Z,http://public-iowadot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/33651c3104144a89a6909ac825a40cf2_0,https://services.arcgis.com/8lRhdTsQyJpO52F1/arcgis/rest/services/Scoping_Park_and_Ride_view/FeatureServer/0,"-96.947,40.259,-89.981,43.751",http://public-iowadot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/33651c3104144a89a6909ac825a40cf2_0

Value was based on how much each location increased the efficiency of the highway network for trucks; condition was based on the Infrastructure Condition Evaluation (ICE) tool?s analysis of condition and traffic data; and performance was based on the INRIX bottleneck ranking tool. Locations were ranked, with annual average truck traffic data being used as a tiebreaker.
