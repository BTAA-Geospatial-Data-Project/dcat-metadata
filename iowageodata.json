The NAIP provides two main products: 1 meter or 60cm GSD ortho imagery rectified within +\/- 4   meters to true ground.  The tiling format of NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75\u0027 x 3.75\u0027 quarter quadrangle with a 300 pixel buffer on all four sides.  The NAIP imagery is formatted to the UTM coordinate system using the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83).  The NAIP imagery may contain as much as 10% cloud cover per tile.  This file was generated by compressing NAIP imagery that covers the county extent.  Two types of compression may be used for NAIP imagery: MrSID and JPEG 2000.

These surficial deposits consist of a variety of glacial, alluvial, outwash, wind-blown (loess and eolian sand), and shallow to bedrock materials. Mappers utilize existing data sources including water well and drilling records, USDA NRCS soil survey data, aerial photography, DEMs, satellite imagery, landform characteristics, and LiDAR. Additional stratigraphic and unit characterization information is obtained through drilling new core holes specifically for these projects. Mapped stratigraphic intervals are portrayed primarily at the formation level. Each unit is characterized by distinctive lithology and landform features which are described in the map legends and metadata. IGS utilizes a landform sediment assemblage approach (LSA) for surficial mapping. Various landforms are the result of specific processes at work in the geologic system. Landforms typically have similar relief, as well as stratigraphic and sedimentologic characteristics. Recognition of the genetic relationship among landforms and their underlying sediment sequences allows one to generalize and map complex glacial terrains over areas of large extent.

Census blocks are relatively small in area; for example, a block in a city bounded by streets. However, census blocks in remote areas are often large and irregular and may even be many square miles in area. A common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used geographically to build all other census geographic areas, rather all other census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints, along with roads and water features, to delineate the tabulation blocks. As a result, all 2010 Census blocks nest within every other 2010 Census geographic area, so that Census Bureau statistical data can be tabulated at the block level and aggregated up to the appropriate geographic areas. Census blocks cover all territory in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas (American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands).

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER\/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. The primary legal divisions of most States are termed counties. In Louisiana, these divisions are known as parishes. In Alaska, which has no counties, the equivalent entities are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs, and municipalities, and for the unorganized area, census areas. The latter are delineated cooperatively for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau. In four States (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more incorporated places that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute primary divisions of their States. These incorporated places are known as independent cities and are treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation. The District of Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is considered an equivalent entity for purposes of data presentation. The Census Bureau treats the following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation: Municipios in Puerto Rico, Districts and Islands in American Samoa, Municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The entire area of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas is covered by counties or equivalent entities.

Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local participants as part of the 2010 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program. The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses. Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses.

The information recorded in these individual Continued Water Use Permits were then distilled into a master ADW EXCEL spreadsheet and updated as needed.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 2008, as many of the continued water use permits approached expiration the IDNR and IDALS desired an updated version of the original ADW shapefile. The resulting updated ADW shapefile would be utilized to field check ADWs by IDNR Field Office Personnel in the winter of 2008 through the spring of 2009 to verify that active (i.e. not closed) ADWs were in compliance with State and Federal rules. An updated ADW shapefile was therefore created utilizing information from the abovementioned master ADW EXCEL file, Continued Water Use Permit Applications, and 1998 ADW shapefile. These data sources were aggregated to produce most of the attribute information. At the same time, locational information in this revised ADW shapefile was improved with the aid of sketches on aerial photo photocopies. These rough approximations of ADW locations were not available during the development of the 1998 ADW shapefile; they were created a year later by landowners while applying for Continued Water Use Permits. Utilizing these landowner sketches, the positions of active ADWs were compared to late 1930s, early 1990s, 2002, and 2006 orthophotography and repositioned (closed and reclassified ADWs were largely excluded from this revision). Additionally, some sites were further refined utilizing LiDAR elevational datasets. This second-generation GIS file was stored as an ESRI point shapefile called \u0022ag_drainage_wells.shp\u0022, Edition 20080908.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUsing the 20080908 Edition of the ADW shapefile, Field Office Personnel carried out their field checks of active ADWs in the winter of 2008 through the spring of 2009. Compliance issues, the condition as well as the status of the wells (closed, fully functioning, etc.) were noted by Field Office Staff and entered into the master ADW EXCEL spreadsheet. This edition of \u0022ag_drainage_wells.shp\u0022 (Edition 20091104) incorporates the Field Office staffs\u0027 observations pertaining to active ADWs that were recorded over the course of 2008-09.\u003C\/p\u003E\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https:\/\/iowageodata.s3.amazonaws.com\/farming\/ag_drainage_wells.zip","mediaType":"text\/html","format":"shp","description":"\u003Cp\u003EWells and intakes\u003C\/p\u003E\n","title":"Agricultural Drainage Wells"}],"identifier":"327b03d3-3381-4744-a96a-dd4e74094abf","issued":"2017-12-12","keyword":["ag drainage well","drainage well","wells","farming"],"license":"http:\/\/opendefinition.org\/licenses\/cc-zero\/","modified":"2017-12-12","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"geodata.iowa.gov"},"spatial":"POLYGON ((-96.712646484375 40.313043208881, -96.712646484375 43.548548110913, -90.142822265625 43.548548110913, -90.142822265625 40.313043208881))","title":"Agricultural Drainage Wells in Iowa","accessLevel":"public","bureauCode":["000:00"],"programCode":["000:000"]},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"fn":"Haddish, Gregg","hasEmail":"mailto:gregg.haddish@ia.usda.gov"},"description":"\u003Cp\u003EThe Soil Survey is a comprehensive inventory of the soil resources of an area.

The bedrock surface is buried by unconsolidated surficial sediments (mostly Quaternary) over most of its extent, but this surface coincides with the modern land surface in areas of bedrock exposure. The map is consistent with all available data including drill records and well samples, as well as surface bedrock exposures (both natural and man-made) and shallow-to-bedrock soils units (NRCS county soils maps). Mapped stratigraphic intervals are portrayed primarily at the group level (i.e., a grouping of bedrock formations), each characterized by distinctive lithologies (rock types) summarized in the map key and associated metadata. The distribution of bedrock units was mapped to conform to the current map of bedrock topography (elevation of the bedrock surface). The structural configurations of relevant stratigraphic datums were intercepted with the bedrock topographic surface to produce the map contacts. The line style shown on the bedrock geologic map qualitatively reflects both data density and degree of certainty of individual stratigraphic contacts. Detailed line work is possible in areas of modern bedrock exposure, but more generalized line work (smooth and more sweeping forms) is portrayed in areas of sparser data control. The new bedrock map is, in part, a revised and updated compilation of seven multi-county bedrock maps prepared between 1998 and 2004 as part of Iowa\u0027s STATEMAP program (funded through U.S. Geological Survey). These maps were further supplemented with other STATEMAP bedrock compilations for portions of northeast and eastern Iowa, although much of the bedrock geology shown for northeast Iowa represents new and previously unpublished information. Bedrock faults are displayed in the map as sharp linear features offsetting mapped stratigraphic units.\u003C\/p\u003E\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https:\/\/iowageodata.s3.amazonaws.com\/geoscientificInformation\/bedrock\/Bedrock_Geologic_Map.zip","mediaType":"text\/html","format":"fgdb","description":"\u003Cp\u003EThis zip file contains a file geodatabase with the following feature classes:\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nBedrock Faults\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nBedrock Geology\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nBedrock Topography\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nBedrock Depth\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nBedrock Surface Elevation\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nBedrock Surface Hillshade\u003C\/p\u003E\n","title":"Bedrock Geology of Iowa"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https:\/\/iowageodata.s3.amazonaws.com\/geoscientificInformation\/bedrock\/geologic_bedrock_exposures.zip","mediaType":"text\/html","format":"shp","description":"\u003Cp\u003EThis polygon data coverage was derived from the Iowa county soil surveys that were digitized by the Iowa Cooperative Soil Survey (ICSS), which includes the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship, and Iowa State University, Cooperative Extension Service and Iowa Agriculture and Home Economics Experiment Station.

NAIP quarter quads are formatted to the UTM coordinate system using NAD83.  NAIP imagery may contain as much as 10%    cloud cover per tile.  This file was generated by compressing NAIP quarter quadrangle tiles that cover a county.  MrSID compression, with mosaic  option, was used.  Target values for the compression ratio  are (50:1) and compression levels(9) are used.\u003C\/p\u003E\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","format":"raster","accessURL":"https:\/\/iowageodata.s3.amazonaws.com\/imageryBaseMapsEarthCover\/imagery\/imagery_2004_NAIP\/Airphotos_2004_NAIP_County_Downloads.html","description":"\u003Cp\u003EEach zip file is a county download.\u003C\/p\u003E\n","title":"2004 NAIP Aerial Photography Downloads"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","format":"esri rest","accessURL":"https:\/\/athene.gis.iastate.edu\/arcgis\/rest\/services\/ortho\/naip_2004_nc\/ImageServer","title":"2004 NAIP Aerial Photography as a Web Service"}],"identifier":"06f1af4f-7564-421a-ad90-e4f623bca354","issued":"2017-11-20","keyword":["Adair County","Adams County","Aerial Photography","Allamakee County","Appanoose County","Audubon County","Benton County","Black Hawk County","Boone County","Bremer County","Buchanan County","Buena Vista County","Butler County","Calhoun County","Carroll County","Cass County","Cedar County","Cerro Gordo County","Cherokee County","Chickasaw County","Clarke County","Clay County","Clayton County","Clinton County","Crawford County","Dallas County","Davis County","Decatur County","Delaware County","Des Moines County","Dickinson County","Dubuque County","Emmet County","Fayette County","Floyd County","Franklin County","Fremont County","Greene County","Grundy County","Guthrie County","Hamilton County","Hancock County","Hardin County","Harrison County","Henry County","Howard County","Humboldt County","Ida County","imagery","Iowa County","Jackson County","Jasper County","Jefferson County","Johnson County","Jones County","Keokuk County","Kossuth County","Lee County","Union County","Van Buren County","Washington County","Warren County","Wapello County","Taylor County","Story County","Tama County","Wright County","Worth County","Woodbury County","Winneshiek County","Winnebago County","Webster County","Wayne County","Sioux County","Shelby County","Montgomery County","Monroe County","Monona County","Mitchell County","Muscatine County","O\u0026#039;Brien County","Mills County","Lucas County","Louisa County","Linn County","Lyon County","Madison County","Marshall County","Marion County","Mahaska County","Osceola County","Ringgold County","Scott County","Sac County","Poweshiek County","Palo Alto County","Page County","Plymouth County","Pottawattamie County","Polk County","Pocahontas County"],"license":"http:\/\/opendefinition.org\/licenses\/cc-zero\/","modified":"2017-11-21","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"geodata.iowa.gov"},"spatial":"POLYGON ((-96.70166015625 40.296286517117, -96.70166015625 43.53262042681, -90.10986328125 43.53262042681, -90.10986328125 40.296286517117))","title":"2004 National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) Aerial Photography of Iowa","bureauCode":["000:00"],"programCode":["000:000"]},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"fn":"Kendall, Daniel ","hasEmail":"mailto:daniel.kendall@dnr.iowa.gov"},"description":"\u003Cp\u003EThis dataset represents waters listed as \u0022impaired\u0022 in Iowa\u0027s Section 305(b) Water Quality Assessment and the 303(d) Impaired Waters Report. Together, these two reports are known as Iowa\u0027s 2014 Integrated Report. Waterbodies in Iowa each have specific designations based on what they are commonly used for-recreation, such as swimming or fishing; drinking water; or maintaining a healthy population of fish and other aquatic life. Every two years, Iowa must report on its progress in meeting water quality goals to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The state prepares one report called the 305(b) Water Quality Assessment or 305(b) list. This 305(b) list categorizes waterbodies to reflect: those that meet all the designated uses (category 1), those in which data availability is insufficient to determine whether any or all designated uses are being met (categories 2 and 3), and those waters in which the water quality prevents it from fully meeting its designated use, and is thus considered \u0022impaired\u0022. New impairments (or category 5 listings) are placed on the \u0022303(d) Impaired Waters Report\u0022, commonly referred to as the \u0022impaired waters list.\u0022 This is named after section 303(d) of the Federal Clean Water Act and means that the stream or lake needs a water quality improvement plan written (also known by a technical name, \u0022Total Maximum Daily Load,\u0022 or \u0022TMDL\u0022). The water quality improvement plan outlines water quality problems, identifies sources of the problem(s), identifies needed reductions in pollutants and offers possible solutions. Water quality improvement plans are approved by the EPA and then the waters are moved from the 303(d) list back to the 305(b) list as category 4 listings (waters considered impaired, but a water quality improvement plan has been written).\u003C\/p\u003E\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https:\/\/iowageodata.s3.amazonaws.com\/inlandWaters\/water_quality\/impaired_waters_2016.zip","mediaType":"text\/html","format":"shp","description":"\u003Cp\u003EThis zip file contains shapefiles for the stream and lake segments.\u003C\/p\u003E\n","title":"2016 Impaired Waters Download"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","format":"rest","accessURL":"https:\/\/programs.iowadnr.gov\/geospatial\/rest\/services\/waterquality\/WaterMonitoring\/MapServer\/2","description":"\u003Cp\u003EA web service of the current impaired lakes in Iowa\u003C\/p\u003E\n","title":"Impaired Lakes Web Service"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","format":"rest","accessURL":"https:\/\/programs.iowadnr.gov\/geospatial\/rest\/services\/waterquality\/WaterMonitoring\/MapServer\/7","description":"\u003Cp\u003EWeb service of impaired streams in Iowa\u003C\/p\u003E\n","title":"Impaired Streams Web Service"}],"identifier":"4c08a1b2-4d18-4f0e-89a2-9ff83a525a45","issued":"2017-11-07","keyword":["303(d) Impaired Waters List","Iowa Water Quality","water quality","waters"],"license":"http:\/\/opendefinition.org\/licenses\/cc-zero\/","modified":"2018-02-07","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"geodata.iowa.gov"},"spatial":"POLYGON ((-96.6796875 40.279525668813, -96.6796875 43.564471587218, -90.02197265625 43.564471587218, -90.02197265625 40.279525668813))","title":"Impaired Waters of Iowa","bureauCode":["000:00"],"programCode":["000:000"]},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","contactPoint":{"fn":"admin","hasEmail":"mailto:noemailprovided@usa.gov"},"description":"\u003Cp\u003ETargeted Service Areas (TSA) are areas NOT meeting broadband speeds of 25 Mbps download and 3 Mbps upload in a designated U.S Census Block.

It has a spatial resolution of one meter, and a class resolution of 15 classes. The target year for the interpretation of the classification is 2009. The Imagery sources are the 2008 NAIP imagery, the 2009 NAIP imagery, and the Four band Spring imagery collected in 2007, 2009 and 2010. Three dates were used because previous experimentation had shown that using fewer dates lacked sufficient spectral information to produce a reasonably consistent classification at the level required. Because each of these imagery layers were collected at widely different dates, to produce consistent classifications required breaking the state into regions or \u0022tiles\u0022 with consistent spectral character. More than 580 such tiles were utilized statewide. Each was independently processed, and separately interpreted and checked. The final products were mosaicked together, then broken out into county files, which is how the files are presented in the NRGIS Library. Although we have done the best job we could to maintain consistency between these many files, it is impossible to maintain absolute consistency in even a small set of files, let alone this large number. The LiDAR data utilized was created by subtracting the Bare Earth DEM from the First Return DEM, yielding a normalized elevation model, which represents the elevation above ground surface of buildings, trees and other vegetation. This layer made an important contribution to producing an accurate classification of buildings and forests. A series of post classification steps were performed to correct problems which were consistent enough to be remedied by this kind of solution. These included embedding rasterized roads, recoding certain shadows, and using the LiDAR to refine building footprints, among others.\u003C\/p\u003E\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","format":"esri rest","accessURL":"https:\/\/programs.iowadnr.gov\/geospatial\/rest\/services\/LandCover\/LC_2009_1m\/MapServer","title":"High Resolution Land Cover of Iowa in 2009 as a Web Service"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","format":"raster","accessURL":"https:\/\/iowageodata.s3.amazonaws.com\/imageryBaseMapsEarthCover\/earthCover\/Land_cover_2009_1m\/HRLC_2009_County_Downloads.html","description":"\u003Cp\u003ECounty dataset in a zipped file.\u003C\/p\u003E\n","title":"High Resolution Land Cover of Iowa in 2009 County Downloads"}],"identifier":"62faee84-5197-482e-91a3-750dfb2cd8aa","issued":"2017-06-08","keyword":["Adams County","Allamakee County","Appanoose County","Audubon County","Benton County","Black Hawk County","Boone County","Bremer County","Buchanan County","Buena Vista County","Butler County","Calhoun County","Carroll County","Cass County","Cedar County","Cerro Gordo County","Cherokee County","Chickasaw County","Clarke County","Clay County","Clayton County","Clinton County","Crawford County","Dallas County","Davis County","Decatur County","Delaware County","Des Moines County","Dickinson County","Dubuque County","Emmet County","Fayette County","Floyd County","Franklin County","Fremont County","Greene County","Grundy County","Guthrie County","Hamilton County","Hancock County","Hardin County","Harrison County","Henry County","Howard County","Humboldt County","Ida County","Iowa County","Jackson County","Jasper County","Jefferson County","Johnson County","Jones County","Keokuk County","Kossuth County","land cover","Lee County","Union County","Van Buren County","Washington County","Warren County","Wapello County","Taylor County","Story County","Tama County","Wright County","Worth County","Woodbury County","Winneshiek County","Winnebago County","Webster County","Wayne County","Sioux County","Shelby County","Montgomery County","Monroe County","Monona County","Mitchell County","Muscatine County","O\u0026#039;Brien County","Mills County","Lucas County","Louisa County","Linn County","Lyon County","Madison County","Marshall County","Marion County","Mahaska County","Osceola County","Ringgold County","Scott County","Sac County","Poweshiek County","Palo Alto County","Page County","Plymouth County","Pottawattamie County","Polk County","Pocahontas County"],"license":"http:\/\/opendefinition.org\/licenses\/cc-zero\/","modified":"2017-11-21","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"geodata.iowa.gov"},"spatial":"POLYGON ((-96.734619140625 40.313043208881, -96.734619140625 43.548548110913, -90.098876953125 43.548548110913, -90.098876953125 40.313043208881))","temporal":"2007-01-01T00:00:00+00:00\/2010-12-31T00:00:00+00:00","title":"High Resolution Land Cover of Iowa in 2009","bureauCode":["000:00"],"programCode":["000:000"]},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","accessLevel":"public","contactPoint":{"fn":"Kohrt, Casey","hasEmail":"mailto:casey.kohrt@dnr.iowa.gov"},"description":"\u003Cp\u003EThe Public Land Survey System (PLSS) is a way of subdividing and describing land in the United States.
