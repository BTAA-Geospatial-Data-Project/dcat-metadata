Feature Collections allow for high-availability. There are unique characteristics that need to be considered when using this data type:?It is a file-based data type so there is no REST endpoint. However, there is JSON that can be parsed out. See link at the bottom of this page.You cannot set a refresh interval in the map document, you must use the Info Summary Widget inside an application or hard-code the refresh in a custom application.The rotation setting gets wiped out each time the dataset is updated.
