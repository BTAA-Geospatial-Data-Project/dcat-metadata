DAS Office of Real Estate can probably give a full list of leased locations.The agencies are currently certifying their data for the July 1st renewal. They are supposed to have all of their changes made by April 6th. I can send you an update at that time, if that will help. You will notice that some locations have records for multiple agencies, since we are now required by our carrier to specify contents and equipment values for each entity within the state building. Those records will show a $0 value for the building except for the building owner. We also have added underground tanks and pipes when the agency requests coverage for them. If you want me to develop a report with only the data you require, please let me know.?Thanks,??Traci Brodie, ARM, AU, AINSRisk Manager, Underwriting  AnalyticsGeneral Services DivisionOffice of Risk Management614-466-6961traci.brodie@das.ohio.gov",2018-03-29T23:15:41.000Z,2018-04-04T15:23:18.953Z,http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/e5b9e0902efe4406b375a1edb2be3030,https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=e5b9e0902efe4406b375a1edb2be3030,"-86.7679,38.668,-78.6545,42.1753"
