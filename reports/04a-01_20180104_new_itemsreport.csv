MPO Boundaries? data includes information on each boundary's name, geographic location, and the total size / extent of each area. MPO Boundaries data was intended to be used for planning purposes within governments at the National and State level. Maryland's MPO Boundaries data is a sub-set of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology's Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) National Transportation Atlas Database (NTAD).?A metropolitan planning organization (MPO) is a federally-mandated and federally-funded transportation policy-making organization that is made up of representatives from local governments and governmental transportation authorities. Federal law requires the formation of an MPO for any urbanized area (UZA) with a population greater than 50,000. Federal funding for transportation projects and programs are channeled through this planning process. Congress created MPOs to ensure that existing and future expenditures of federal funds for transportation projects and programs are based on a continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive (?3?C?) planning process. MPOs are charged with developing a 20-year long-range transportation plan (LRTP) and a short-term (usually 2-6 years) program called the transportation improvement program (TIP) for each of their respective regions. 

The seven MPOs of which Maryland jurisdictions and agencies are members are listed below. The Maryland member jurisdictions are listed under each MPO (note that some MPOs cover multi-State regions). The Maryland Department of Transportation is a member of each of the MPOs listed. Each of the listed member?jurisdictions?has a different level of involvement with its MPO.Maryland's MPOs are as follows:?National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board (TPB)https://www.mwcog.org/tpb/- Charles County, Maryland- Frederick County, Maryland- Montgomery County, Maryland- Prince George's County, Maryland- City of Bowie, Maryland- City of College Park, Maryland- City of Frederick, Maryland- City of Gaithersburg, Maryland- City of Greenbelt, Maryland- City of Laurel, Maryland-?City?of Rockville, Maryland- City of Takoma Park, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Baltimore Regional Transportation Board (BRTB)https://baltometro.org/- Anne Arundel County, Maryland- Baltimore County, Maryland- Carroll County, Maryland- Harford County, Maryland- Howard County, Maryland- Queen Anne's County, Maryland- City of Annapolis, Maryland- City of Baltimore, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Cumberland Area Metropolitan Planning Organization (CAMPO)http://alleganygov.org/473/Metropolitan-Planning-Organization- Allegany County, Maryland- City of Cumberland, Maryland- City of Frostburg, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Hagerstown / Eastern Panhandle Metropolitan Planning Organization (HEPMPO)https://www.hepmpo.net/- Washington County, Maryland- City of Hagerstown, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Wilmington Area Planning Council (WILMAPCO)http://www.wilmapco.org/- Cecil County, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Salisbury / Wicomico Metropolitan Planning Organization (S / WMPO)http://www.swmpo.org/- Wicomico County, Maryland- City of Fruitland, Maryland-?City?of Salisbury, Maryland- Town of Delmar, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Calvert-St. Mary?s Metropolitan Planning Organization (C - SMMPO)http://www.calvert-stmarysmpo.com/- Calvert County, Maryland- St. Mary's County, Maryland- Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT)Maryland's MPO Boundaries data is owned and maintained by the Transportation Secretary's Office (TSO) of the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT).

Find more information at?http://imap.maryland.gov.Roadway Functional Classification consists of linear features which specifically show the functional classification of public roadways in the State of Maryland. Roadway Functional Classification is defined as the role each roadway plays in moving vehicles throughout a network of highways. Roadway Functional Classification is primarily used for general planning purposes, and for Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) annual submission  coordination. The Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) currently reports this data only on the inventory direction (generally North or East) side of the roadway. Roadway Functional Classification data is not a complete representation of all roadway geometry.Maryland's roadway system is a vast network that connects places and people within and across county borders. Planners and engineers have developed elements of this network with particular travel objectives in mind. These objectives range from serving long-distance passenger and freight needs to serving neighborhood travel from residential developments to nearby shopping centers. The functional classification of roadways defines the role each element of the roadway network plays in serving these travel needs. ? Over the years, functional classification has come to assume additional significance beyond its purpose as a framework for identifying the particular role of a roadway in moving vehicles through a network of highways. Functional classification carries with it expectations about roadway design, including its speed, capacity and relationship to existing and future land use development. Federal legislation continues to use functional classification in determining eligibility for funding under the Federal-aid program. Transportation agencies describe roadway system performance, benchmarks and targets by functional classification. As agencies continue to move towards a more performance-based management approach, functional classification will be an increasingly important consideration in setting expectations and measuring outcomes for preservation, mobility and safety.Roadway Functional Classification data is developed as part of the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) which maintains and reports transportation related information to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on an annual basis. HPMS is maintained by the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), under the Office of Planning and Preliminary Engineering (OPPE) Data Services Division (DSD).?Roadway Functional Classification?data is used by various modules throughout MDOT, as well as many other Federal, State and local government agencies.
