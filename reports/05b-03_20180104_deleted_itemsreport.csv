Parcel data was developed to map and track property boundaries.  The attributes of the parcel data are in the MetroGIS Standard format.

DescriptionThe geometry of parcels
 were created by Carver County's Survey department using COGO in an 
AutoCad environment. The AutoCad lines have been imported into a ArcGIS 
Geodatabase and polygons built. These polygons are attributed with a 
Parcel Identification Number (PID). The GIS polygons are joined by PID 
to the Assessor's CAMA system and Taxpayer Services tax database to show
 attributes of the property.
