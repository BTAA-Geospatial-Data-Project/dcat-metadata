benefit from special accessible conditions to reach our outdoor and wildlife
resources.? The DNR website has details
and a wide variety of accessible, ADA compliant rules, guidelines and features
and (see webpage http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-153-10366_41825---,00.html and subpage on hunting / wildlife

specific wheelchairs, personal assistive mobility devices (PAMDs), or other
motorized-type vehicles.? 

Please
check rules for specific rules, regulations, and restrictions as they relate to
what equipment might be used, before using such equipment, as not all equipment
legal on public places, residential or commercial buildings, or such are
allowed on all areas of Michigan?s public land managed by the DNR.

?

Accessible
features on State Wildlife/Game Area include those which have low-slope, no
stairs or steps along features, and are accessible for wheelchairs, or personal
assistive mobility devices (PAMDs).? All
buildings, DNR Shooting-Ranges, and other permanent public use structures are
fully ADA compliant and accessible.? It
is the more natural features being identified in this layer.? Many of these features are fully ADA code
compliant (which is ~1 inch rise or less over 12 inch distances) and are
regularly checked for obstructions, while other features comply with the
low-slope requirements or are identified as such so they are not over-represented
to a lower or no slope level.? In natural
rustic areas it can be difficult to maintain these slope limits and to clearing
check for naturally-occurring obstructions like leaves, sticks or other
naturally occurring items which blow or wash onto trails or outside features.? Therefore, features are frequently identified
as no-slope or low-slope/PAMD levels and not over-represented as fully ADA
compliant.? 

?

The
DNR Wildlife Division is in a updated state-wide review to identify features
and provide better information on accessible features, such as by GIS
compatible layers provided here.? Accessible
features typically include accessible combinations of parking, a trail and a
destination location like a platform or blind location; read the attribute
fields like the ?comment? field, for details on what is at the provided data
point, line or polygon.? Although
available for use by anyone, it's hoped consideration for use will be given to
those individuals that have limited mobility, please, for use of these accessible
parking, trails, blinds or platforms, and other features.? Patience is appreciated for local site
conditions which might be caused by weather, wind or rain, wildlife or other
public users; please report any problems with features to either the local DNR

Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) does have many locations or
features which help or particularly benefit those public users, photography
enthusiasts, birdwatchers, or hunters who have special mobility needs and
benefit from special accessible conditions to reach our outdoor and wildlife
resources.? The DNR website has details
and a wide variety of accessible, ADA compliant rules, guidelines and features
and (see webpage http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-153-10366_41825---,00.html and subpage on hunting / wildlife
information at http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-153-10366_41825_51108---,00.html ).?
Users may require only walking assistance devices or may be those with
specific wheelchairs, personal assistive mobility devices (PAMDs), or other
motorized-type vehicles.? 

Please
check rules for specific rules, regulations, and restrictions as they relate to
what equipment might be used, before using such equipment, as not all equipment
legal on public places, residential or commercial buildings, or such are
allowed on all areas of Michigan?s public land managed by the DNR.

?

Accessible
features on State Wildlife/Game Area include those which have low-slope, no
stairs or steps along features, and are accessible for wheelchairs, or personal
assistive mobility devices (PAMDs).? All
buildings, DNR Shooting-Ranges, and other permanent public use structures are
fully ADA compliant and accessible.? It
is the more natural features being identified in this layer.? Many of these features are fully ADA code
compliant (which is ~1 inch rise or less over 12 inch distances) and are
regularly checked for obstructions, while other features comply with the
low-slope requirements or are identified as such so they are not over-represented
to a lower or no slope level.? In natural
rustic areas it can be difficult to maintain these slope limits and to clearing
check for naturally-occurring obstructions like leaves, sticks or other
naturally occurring items which blow or wash onto trails or outside features.? Therefore, features are frequently identified
as no-slope or low-slope/PAMD levels and not over-represented as fully ADA
compliant.? 

?

The
DNR Wildlife Division is in a updated state-wide review to identify features
and provide better information on accessible features, such as by GIS
compatible layers provided here.? Accessible
features typically include accessible combinations of parking, a trail and a
destination location like a platform or blind location; read the attribute
fields like the ?comment? field, for details on what is at the provided data
point, line or polygon.? Although
available for use by anyone, it's hoped consideration for use will be given to
those individuals that have limited mobility, please, for use of these accessible
parking, trails, blinds or platforms, and other features.? Patience is appreciated for local site
conditions which might be caused by weather, wind or rain, wildlife or other
public users; please report any problems with features to either the local DNR
Wildlife office or the main DNR Wildlife help options (e-mail DNR-Wildlife@michigan.gov , or call 517-284-9453).",2016-10-26T15:39:28.000Z,2017-11-08T20:12:03.000Z,http://gis-mdot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/6a4017135ea54a21aabb0f48b8ba1630_7,https://gisago.mcgi.state.mi.us/arcgis/rest/services/DNR/dnrWildlife/MapServer/7,"-180.0,-59.7617,180.0,48.1479"

The baseflow of a stream or river is the amount of groundwater discharged from an aquifer to the watercourse. This discharge occurs year-round, and fluctuates seasonally depending on the level of the water in the aquifer. Baseflow is supplemented by direct runoff during and immediately after precipitation or melt events, resulting in peaks on a hydrograph showing stream flow through time. The process of dividing these peaks into base flow and runoff is called hydrograph separation. Hydrograph separations were completed for all USGS stream- flow gaging stations in Michigan that had more than 10 years of daily records. Sites that were clearly affected by upstream impoundments (lakes, dams) were excluded. No attempt was made to detect or correct for trends in the data. This may lead to some errors in the comparison of streams with data from different time periods if there is an underlying temporal trend in the data, but inclusion of all records in the analysis was necessary to increase the data pool and provide better spatial coverage. Watersheds were delineated for each of the 208 stream-flow gaging stations, and various characteristics of each watershed, such as topographic relief, surficial geology, land cover, growing degree days, annual and winter-season precipitation, and others were tabulated. Regression modeling, described in the Technical Report, was used to estimate the baseflow for each steam segment of the 1:100,000-scale National Hydrography Dataset.",2017-04-27T12:21:24.000Z,2017-12-18T17:22:55.326Z,http://gis-mdot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/1c9b201348d14654a3e011c7db3076de_3,https://gisago.mcgi.state.mi.us/arcgis/rest/services/OpenData/hydro/MapServer/3,"-90.3951,41.2769,-82.4174,47.4692"

Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) does have many locations or
features which help or particularly benefit those public users, photography
enthusiasts, birdwatchers, or hunters who have special mobility needs and
benefit from special accessible conditions to reach our outdoor and wildlife
resources.? The DNR website has details
and a wide variety of accessible, ADA compliant rules, guidelines and features
and (see webpage http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-153-10366_41825---,00.html and subpage on hunting / wildlife
information at http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-153-10366_41825_51108---,00.html ).?
Users may require only walking assistance devices or may be those with
specific wheelchairs, personal assistive mobility devices (PAMDs), or other
motorized-type vehicles.? 

Please
check rules for specific rules, regulations, and restrictions as they relate to
what equipment might be used, before using such equipment, as not all equipment
legal on public places, residential or commercial buildings, or such are
allowed on all areas of Michigan?s public land managed by the DNR.

?

Accessible
features on State Wildlife/Game Area include those which have low-slope, no
stairs or steps along features, and are accessible for wheelchairs, or personal
assistive mobility devices (PAMDs).? All
buildings, DNR Shooting-Ranges, and other permanent public use structures are
fully ADA compliant and accessible.? It
is the more natural features being identified in this layer.? Many of these features are fully ADA code
compliant (which is ~1 inch rise or less over 12 inch distances) and are
regularly checked for obstructions, while other features comply with the
low-slope requirements or are identified as such so they are not over-represented
to a lower or no slope level.? In natural
rustic areas it can be difficult to maintain these slope limits and to clearing
check for naturally-occurring obstructions like leaves, sticks or other
naturally occurring items which blow or wash onto trails or outside features.? Therefore, features are frequently identified
as no-slope or low-slope/PAMD levels and not over-represented as fully ADA
compliant.? 

?

The
DNR Wildlife Division is in a updated state-wide review to identify features
and provide better information on accessible features, such as by GIS
compatible layers provided here.? Accessible
features typically include accessible combinations of parking, a trail and a
destination location like a platform or blind location; read the attribute
fields like the ?comment? field, for details on what is at the provided data
point, line or polygon.? Although
available for use by anyone, it's hoped consideration for use will be given to
those individuals that have limited mobility, please, for use of these accessible
parking, trails, blinds or platforms, and other features.? Patience is appreciated for local site
conditions which might be caused by weather, wind or rain, wildlife or other
public users; please report any problems with features to either the local DNR
Wildlife office or the main DNR Wildlife help options (e-mail DNR-Wildlife@michigan.gov , or call 517-284-9453).",2016-10-27T15:25:26.000Z,2017-11-08T20:12:54.000Z,http://gis-mdot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/bbd38e254c3a40a498678a1f59c38f72_9,https://gisago.mcgi.state.mi.us/arcgis/rest/services/DNR/dnrWildlife/MapServer/9,"-88.4629,42.3897,-83.9603,47.1726"
