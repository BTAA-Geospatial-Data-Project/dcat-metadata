Find more information on?http://imap.maryland.gov.To quantify shoreline rates of change (erosion or accretion), Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) used historical and recent shorelines spanning 1994-2011 as input into the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) Version 4.3. DSAS, a computer program developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), determines linear rates of shoreline change along closely spaced, shore-normal transects. Based on DSAS output, MGS assigned generalized rate of change categories as attributes to a recent shoreline for Baltimore County. This recent shoreline consisted of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Continually Updated Shoreline Product (CUSP) digital shoreline currently available for Baltimore County. Based on the results of an End Point Rate (EPR) analysis on the ca. 1990s shoreline and the ca. 2000/2010 shoreline (recent shoreline), MGS grouped the rate results into the following general categories: (a) No change (-0.01 to 0.01 feet/year), (b) Accretion (greater than 0.01 feet/year), (c) Slight erosion rate (0 to -2 feet/year), (d) Low erosion rate (-2 to -4 feet/year), (e) Moderate erosion rate (-4 to -8 ft/yr), (f) High erosion rate (greater than -8 feet/year), (g) Protected, (h) No data (insufficient shorelines to calculate 10-year EPR rate), (i) No data (no transects cast; unprotected or unknown shoreline condition), and (j) No data (rates not delivered; calculated rates suspect). Negative rate of change values indicate erosion, and positive values indicate accretion.

DSAS, a computer program developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), determines linear rates of shoreline change along closely spaced, shore-normal transects. Based on DSAS output, MGS assigned generalized rate of change categories as attributes to a recent shoreline for Anne Arundel County. This recent shoreline consisted of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Continually Updated Shoreline Product (CUSP) digital shoreline currently available for Anne Arundel County; and 2) portions of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (MD DNR) Critical Area Commission (CAC) digital shoreline for Anne Arundel County. Based on the results of an End Point Rate (EPR) analysis on the ca. 1970s shoreline and the ca. 2000/2010 shoreline (recent shoreline), MGS grouped the rate results into the following general categories: (a) No change (-0.01 to 0.01 feet/year), (b) Accretion (greater than 0.01 feet/year), (c) Slight erosion rate (0 to -2 feet/year), (d) Low erosion rate (-2 to -4 feet/year), (e) Moderate erosion rate (-4 to -8 ft/yr), (f) High erosion rate (greater than -8 feet/year), (g) Protected, (h) No data (insufficient shorelines to calculate 30-year EPR rate), (i) No data (no transects cast; unprotected or unknown shoreline condition), and (j) No data (rates not delivered; calculated rates suspect). The CUSP shoreline represents the shoreline position in Anne Arundel County between the years 2005-2010. The CAC shoreline represents the shoreline position in Anne Arundel County in 2007. In Anne Arundel County, the NOAA CUSP data set covered all shoreline in the county with the exception of the Patuxent River along the western county border. As such, MGS utilized the CAC shoreline data set in the Patuxent River area. To identify which shoreline source is responsible for a shoreline segment, view the DSAS_SRC attribute table field -- CAC indicates a shoreline sourced from MD DNR CAC data set; NOAA CUSP indicates a shoreline sourced from the NOAA CUSP data set.

(EDI) of Gaithersburg, MD in 2000. EDI extracted the shorelines from an existing wetlands delineation, which was based on photo interpretation of 3.75-minute digital orthophoto quarter quads (DOQQs). This shoreline feature class was created by appending the twenty individual shoreline data sets into one master shoreline feature class file, and retains the original attribute field names from the twenty input files. As such, the original attribute information for each input dataset is part of this final shoreline feature class. MGS also created seven additional attribute fields, some which are required for DSAS analysis and some of which facilitated general data management/analysis -- DSAS_DATE, DSAS_UNC, DSAS_SRC, DSAS_DEC, DSAS_CO, DSAS_NPROJ, and DSAS_SLINF.Here is a list of the individual data sets (by source) compiled for this master shoreline feature class (all data sets clipped to county boundaries): 1) NOAA Historical Surveys (T-sheets) data sets -- CM7202; 2) NOAA National Shoreline data sets -- CS288, MD1932A1, MD1932A2, MD1932A3, MD1932B, MD1933D, MD1933E, MD1933F, MD1934A, CS307, MD1941A1, PH6008, PH6009A, PH6609, CM7415, and CM7601; 3) MGS data sets -- 1940 and 1990 MGS shoreline; and 4) NOAA CUSP data set.Last Updated: 6/2017Map Service Link:?http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Hydrology/MD_ShorelineChanges/MapServer/2",2017-06-23T13:33:32.000Z,2017-06-23T13:36:24.000Z,http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/99c8157746a54ddfa3dc3d2b9d7f8161_2,http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Hydrology/MD_ShorelineChanges/MapServer/2,"-77.077,38.3161,-76.0597,39.6564",http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/99c8157746a54ddfa3dc3d2b9d7f8161_2

Find more information on?http://imap.maryland.gov.To quantify shoreline rates of change (erosion or accretion), Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) used historical and recent shorelines spanning 1993-2007 as input into the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) Version 4.3. DSAS, a computer program developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), determines linear rates of shoreline change along closely spaced, shore-normal transects. Based on DSAS output, MGS assigned generalized rate of change categories as attributes to a recent shoreline for Calvert County. This recent shoreline consisted of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Continually Updated Shoreline Product (CUSP) digital shoreline currently available for Calvert County; and 2) portions of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (MD DNR) Critical Area Commission (CAC) digital shoreline for Calvert County. Based on the results of an End Point Rate (EPR) analysis on the ca. 1990s shoreline and the ca. 2000 shoreline (recent shoreline), MGS grouped the rate results into the following general categories: (a) No change (-0.01 to 0.01 feet/year), (b) Accretion (greater than 0.01 feet/year), (c) Slight erosion rate (0 to -2 feet/year), (d) Low erosion rate (-2 to -4 feet/year), (e) Moderate erosion rate (-4 to -8 ft/yr), (f) High erosion rate (greater than -8 feet/year), (g) Protected, (h) No data (insufficient shorelines to calculate 10-year EPR rate), (i) No data (no transects cast; unprotected or unknown shoreline condition), and (j) Rates not delivered (calculated rates suspect). The NOAA CUSP shoreline represents the shoreline position in Calvert County between the years 2005-2006. The CAC shoreline represents the shoreline position in Calvert County in 2007. In Calvert County, the NOAA CUSP data set covered approximately 90% of the shoreline in the county. MGS supplemented the NOAA CUSP data with CAC data in the following areas where NOAA CUSP data was missing: Hunting Creek; upper 2/3 of Hall Creek; and Patuxent River, from approximately 1 kilometer south of the Merkle Wildlife Sanctuary, north to (and including) Lyons Creek. To identify which shoreline source is responsible for a shoreline segment, view the DSAS_SRC attribute table field -- CAC indicates a shoreline sourced from MD DNR CAC data set; NOAA CUSP indicates a shoreline sourced from the NOAA CUSP data set. Negative rate of change values indicate erosion, and positive values indicate accretion. In general, MGS tried to attribute lengths of shoreline of at least 80 meters in length sharing similar rates of change.Last Updated: 6/2017Map Service Link:?http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Hydrology/MD_ShorelineChanges/MapServer/8",2017-06-23T13:58:19.000Z,2017-06-23T13:59:26.000Z,http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/9156f8a60c2a42b9a7d0e740ecdcd7e3_8,http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Hydrology/MD_ShorelineChanges/MapServer/8,"-76.7012,38.3164,-76.3813,38.7576",http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/9156f8a60c2a42b9a7d0e740ecdcd7e3_8
