These data were developed from LIDAR data obtained between April 16, 2007 and May 07, 2007, and further supplemented by break lines collected from aerial photography taken at the same time. The contours and the aerial photography meet National Map Accuracy Standards for a 1 inch = 100 foot product. The contours have been created to be cartographically pleasing, as such some generalization has been introduced as expected. The contours have been tested against the original LIDAR points and conforms to the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) Specifications and Standards Committee, 1990, ASPRS Accuracy Standards for Large-Scale Maps, CLASS 1 map accuracy. The vertical datum is the North American Vertical Datum of 1988.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers?Engineering and Design Manual for Photogrammetric Production?recommends that data intended for this usage scale be used for any of the following purposes: route location, preliminary alignment and design, preliminary project planning, hydraulic sections, rough earthwork estimates, or high-gradient terrain / low unit cost earthwork excavation estimates. The manual does not recommend that these data be used for final design, excavation and grading plans, earthwork computations for bid estimates or contract measurement and payment.Contour data is used by county agencies to study drainage issues such as flooding and erosion. Customers interested in the actual LiDAR data may download it at no cost from the USGS Center for LiDAR Information Coordination and Knowledge.These files are tiled by PLSS section and grouped by township and format for easier download.

Parts of the county were not captured including some areas in Buffalo Grove, Highland Park, and Riverwoods.

It accounts for atmospheric effects, site latitude and elevation, steepness (slope) and compass direction (aspect), daily and seasonal shifts of the sun angle, and effects of shadows cast by surrounding topography. The resultant outputs can be easily integrated with other GIS data and can help model physical and biological processes as they are affected by the sun.These data are derived from other data sources, no accuracy measurements or tests were conducted. Primary use and intent for these data are for visualizations and topographic analysis.

This was created using the ground (class = 2) lidar points and incorporating the breaklines.The DTMs were developed using LiDAR data. LiDAR is an acronym for LIght Detection And Ranging. Light detection and ranging is the science of using a laser to measure distances to specific points. A specially equipped airplane with positioning tools and LiDAR technology was used to measure the distance to the surface of the earth to determine ground elevation. The classified points were developed using data collected in April to May 2007. The LiDAR points, specialized software, and technology provide the ability to create a high precision three-dimensional digital elevation and/or terrain models (DEM/DTM). The use of LiDAR significantly reduces the cost for developing this information.The DTMs are intended to correspond to the orthometric heights of the bare surface of the county (no buildings or vegetation cover). DTM data is used by county agencies to study drainage issues such as flooding and erosion; contour generation; slope and aspect; and hill shade images.

This was created using all points (excluding NOISE) from our 2007 LiDAR data without incorporating the breaklines. Merrick and Co. MARS (ver. 8.0.4, build 8185) software was used to create the GeoTIFF images.The DSMs were developed using LiDAR data. LiDAR is an acronym for LIght Detection And Ranging. Light detection and ranging is the science of using a laser to measure distances to specific points. A specially equipped airplane with positioning tools and LiDAR technology was used to measure the distance to the surface of the earth. The classified points were developed using data collected in April to May 2007. The LiDAR points, specialized software, and technology provide the ability to create a high precision three-dimensional digital elevation and/or terrain models (DEM/DTM) as well as digital surface models (DSM). The use of LiDAR significantly reduces the cost for developing this information.The DSMs are intended to correspond to the orthometric heights of the surface of the county including above ground features such as buildings, vegetation cover, utility structures, vehicles ... etc. DSM data are used by county agencies and others to study drainage issues such as flooding and erosion; contour generation; slope and aspect; and hill shade images. Elevation data and models are used in several different ways including:Visualization representations of the elevation data. Examples include:-	A hillshaded or shaded relief image-	An image representing slope-	An image representing aspectAnalysis of the elevation data and analytical products which can be generated. Examples include:-	Viewshed calculations for visibility and line-of-sight analysis-	Areas of highest Solar energy potential-	Uses in disaster management-	Industrial planning-	Calculation of cartographic contours-	Calculation of profiles along straight lines or line segmentsThese data are derived from other data sources, no accuracy measurements or tests were conducted.

This was created using all points (excluding NOISE) from our 2007 LiDAR data without incorporating the breaklines. Merrick and Co. MARS (ver. 8.0.4, build 8185) software was used to create the GeoTIFF images.The DSMs were developed using LiDAR data. LiDAR is an acronym for LIght Detection And Ranging. Light detection and ranging is the science of using a laser to measure distances to specific points. A specially equipped airplane with positioning tools and LiDAR technology was used to measure the distance to the surface of the earth. The classified points were developed using data collected in April to May 2007. The LiDAR points, specialized software, and technology provide the ability to create a high precision three-dimensional digital elevation and/or terrain models (DEM/DTM) as well as digital surface models (DSM). The use of LiDAR significantly reduces the cost for developing this information.The DSMs are intended to correspond to the orthometric heights of the surface of the county including above ground features such as buildings, vegetation cover, utility structures, vehicles ... etc. DSM data are used by county agencies and others to study drainage issues such as flooding and erosion; contour generation; slope and aspect; and hill shade images. Elevation data and models are used in several different ways including:Visualization representations of the elevation data. Examples include:-	A hillshaded or shaded relief image-	An image representing slope-	An image representing aspectAnalysis of the elevation data and analytical products which can be generated. Examples include:-	Viewshed calculations for visibility and line-of-sight analysis-	Areas of highest Solar energy potential-	Uses in disaster management-	Industrial planning-	Calculation of cartographic contours-	Calculation of profiles along straight lines or line segmentsThese data are derived from other data sources, no accuracy measurements or tests were conducted.

This was created using all points (excluding NOISE) from our 2007 LiDAR data without incorporating the breaklines. Merrick and Co. MARS (ver. 8.0.4, build 8185) software was used to create the GeoTIFF images.The DSMs were developed using LiDAR data. LiDAR is an acronym for LIght Detection And Ranging. Light detection and ranging is the science of using a laser to measure distances to specific points. A specially equipped airplane with positioning tools and LiDAR technology was used to measure the distance to the surface of the earth. The classified points were developed using data collected in April to May 2007. The LiDAR points, specialized software, and technology provide the ability to create a high precision three-dimensional digital elevation and/or terrain models (DEM/DTM) as well as digital surface models (DSM). The use of LiDAR significantly reduces the cost for developing this information.The DSMs are intended to correspond to the orthometric heights of the surface of the county including above ground features such as buildings, vegetation cover, utility structures, vehicles ... etc. DSM data are used by county agencies and others to study drainage issues such as flooding and erosion; contour generation; slope and aspect; and hill shade images. Elevation data and models are used in several different ways including:Visualization representations of the elevation data. Examples include:-	A hillshaded or shaded relief image-	An image representing slope-	An image representing aspectAnalysis of the elevation data and analytical products which can be generated. Examples include:-	Viewshed calculations for visibility and line-of-sight analysis-	Areas of highest Solar energy potential-	Uses in disaster management-	Industrial planning-	Calculation of cartographic contours-	Calculation of profiles along straight lines or line segmentsThese data are derived from other data sources, no accuracy measurements or tests were conducted. Primary use and intent for these data are for visualizations and topographic analysis.

These data were developed from LIDAR data obtained between April 16, 2007 and May 07, 2007, and further supplemented by break lines collected from aerial photography taken at the same time. The contours and the aerial photography meet National Map Accuracy Standards for a 1 inch = 100 foot product. The contours have been created to be cartographically pleasing, as such some generalization has been introduced as expected. The contours have been tested against the original LIDAR points and conforms to the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) Specifications and Standards Committee, 1990, ASPRS Accuracy Standards for Large-Scale Maps, CLASS 1 map accuracy. The vertical datum is the North American Vertical Datum of 1988.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers?Engineering and Design Manual for Photogrammetric Production?recommends that data intended for this usage scale be used for any of the following purposes: route location, preliminary alignment and design, preliminary project planning, hydraulic sections, rough earthwork estimates, or high-gradient terrain / low unit cost earthwork excavation estimates. The manual does not recommend that these data be used for final design, excavation and grading plans, earthwork computations for bid estimates or contract measurement and payment.Contour data is used by county agencies to study drainage issues such as flooding and erosion.

They were then scanned by the USGS and georeferenced by Lake County in 2007. This data should NOT be used at a scale larger than 1 inch = 400 feet. Due to the lack of sufficient camera calibration information, errors will increase towards the margin of each underlying photo, although this effect has been minimized by cropping individual photos to make this mosaic. Since these photos were scanned from old film, local distortions (from the media stretching and/or shrinking) may be present as well as fading. Parts of the county were not captured including some areas in Buffalo Grove, Highland Park, and Riverwoods. The date of the flight means that most trees have fully leaf-out canopies, which obscure some ground features. This flight took place during a period of high population growth and land use change.

These data were developed from LIDAR data obtained between April 16, 2007 and May 07, 2007, and further supplemented by break lines collected from aerial photography taken at the same time. The contours and the aerial photography meet National Map Accuracy Standards for a 1 inch = 100 foot product. The contours have been created to be cartographically pleasing, as such some generalization has been introduced as expected. The contours have been tested against the original LIDAR points and conforms to the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) Specifications and Standards Committee, 1990, ASPRS Accuracy Standards for Large-Scale Maps, CLASS 1 map accuracy. The vertical datum is the North American Vertical Datum of 1988.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers?Engineering and Design Manual for Photogrammetric Production?recommends that data intended for this usage scale be used for any of the following purposes: route location, preliminary alignment and design, preliminary project planning, hydraulic sections, rough earthwork estimates, or high-gradient terrain / low unit cost earthwork excavation estimates. The manual does not recommend that these data be used for final design, excavation and grading plans, earthwork computations for bid estimates or contract measurement and payment.Contour data is used by county agencies to study drainage issues such as flooding and erosion. Customers interested in the actual LiDAR data may download it at no cost from the USGS Center for LiDAR Information Coordination and Knowledge.These files are tiled by PLSS section and grouped by township and format for easier download.

They were scanned in 2001, and georeferenced in 2002. This data should NOT be used at a scale larger than 1 inch = 400 feet. Due to the lack of sufficient camera calibration information, errors will increase towards the margin of each underlying photo, although this effect has been minimized by cropping individual photos to make this mosaic. Since these photos were scanned from paper prints, local distortions (from the media stretching and/or shrinking) may be present as well as pen marks and fading. Caution should be used in interpreting features in this photography with reference to current conditions. In particular, many roads and road intersections have been realigned in the more than 60 years since this photography was taken. This historic aerial photography was captured in digital form as the result of a cooperative project between the Illinois State Geological Survey and the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Mapping Division of the Lake County Department of Information Technology. It is part of a statewide program to preserve the oldest known extensive aerial photography for future generations. The original photography was performed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as part of a nation-wide program for use in agricultural assessment.

The DSM is a 3-foot pixel resolution raster in GeoTIFF format, created using all points (excluding NOISE) from our 2007 LiDAR data without incorporating the breaklines. The SRPM was created using the ArcGIS 'Area Solar Radiation' geoprocessing tool. Due to the number of variables and parameters, the default values of the geoprocessing tool were used.The solar radiation analysis tools in the ArcGIS Spatial Analyst extension enables one to map and analyze the effects of the sun over a geographic area for specific time periods. It accounts for atmospheric effects, site latitude and elevation, steepness (slope) and compass direction (aspect), daily and seasonal shifts of the sun angle, and effects of shadows cast by surrounding topography.

This was created using all points (excluding NOISE) from our 2007 LiDAR data without incorporating the breaklines. Merrick and Co. MARS (ver. 8.0.4, build 8185) software was used to create the GeoTIFF images.The DSMs were developed using LiDAR data. LiDAR is an acronym for LIght Detection And Ranging. Light detection and ranging is the science of using a laser to measure distances to specific points. A specially equipped airplane with positioning tools and LiDAR technology was used to measure the distance to the surface of the earth. The classified points were developed using data collected in April to May 2007. The LiDAR points, specialized software, and technology provide the ability to create a high precision three-dimensional digital elevation and/or terrain models (DEM/DTM) as well as digital surface models (DSM). The use of LiDAR significantly reduces the cost for developing this information.The DSMs are intended to correspond to the orthometric heights of the surface of the county including above ground features such as buildings, vegetation cover, utility structures, vehicles ... etc. DSM data are used by county agencies and others to study drainage issues such as flooding and erosion; contour generation; slope and aspect; and hill shade images. Elevation data and models are used in several different ways including:Visualization representations of the elevation data. Examples include:-	A hillshaded or shaded relief image-	An image representing slope-	An image representing aspectAnalysis of the elevation data and analytical products which can be generated. Examples include:-	Viewshed calculations for visibility and line-of-sight analysis-	Areas of highest Solar energy potential-	Uses in disaster management-	Industrial planning-	Calculation of cartographic contours-	Calculation of profiles along straight lines or line segmentsThese data are derived from other data sources, no accuracy measurements or tests were conducted.

These data were developed from LIDAR data obtained between April 16, 2007 and May 07, 2007, and further supplemented by break lines collected from aerial photography taken at the same time. The contours and the aerial photography meet National Map Accuracy Standards for a 1 inch = 100 foot product. The contours have been created to be cartographically pleasing, as such some generalization has been introduced as expected. The contours have been tested against the original LIDAR points and conforms to the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) Specifications and Standards Committee, 1990, ASPRS Accuracy Standards for Large-Scale Maps, CLASS 1 map accuracy. The vertical datum is the North American Vertical Datum of 1988.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers?Engineering and Design Manual for Photogrammetric Production?recommends that data intended for this usage scale be used for any of the following purposes: route location, preliminary alignment and design, preliminary project planning, hydraulic sections, rough earthwork estimates, or high-gradient terrain / low unit cost earthwork excavation estimates. The manual does not recommend that these data be used for final design, excavation and grading plans, earthwork computations for bid estimates or contract measurement and payment.Contour data is used by county agencies to study drainage issues such as flooding and erosion.

This was created using all points (excluding NOISE) from our 2007 LiDAR data without incorporating the breaklines. Merrick and Co. MARS (ver. 8.0.4, build 8185) software was used to create the GeoTIFF images.The DSMs were developed using LiDAR data. LiDAR is an acronym for LIght Detection And Ranging. Light detection and ranging is the science of using a laser to measure distances to specific points. A specially equipped airplane with positioning tools and LiDAR technology was used to measure the distance to the surface of the earth. The classified points were developed using data collected in April to May 2007. The LiDAR points, specialized software, and technology provide the ability to create a high precision three-dimensional digital elevation and/or terrain models (DEM/DTM) as well as digital surface models (DSM). The use of LiDAR significantly reduces the cost for developing this information.The DSMs are intended to correspond to the orthometric heights of the surface of the county including above ground features such as buildings, vegetation cover, utility structures, vehicles ... etc. DSM data are used by county agencies and others to study drainage issues such as flooding and erosion; contour generation; slope and aspect; and hill shade images. Elevation data and models are used in several different ways including:Visualization representations of the elevation data. Examples include:-	A hillshaded or shaded relief image-	An image representing slope-	An image representing aspectAnalysis of the elevation data and analytical products which can be generated. Examples include:-	Viewshed calculations for visibility and line-of-sight analysis-	Areas of highest Solar energy potential-	Uses in disaster management-	Industrial planning-	Calculation of cartographic contours-	Calculation of profiles along straight lines or line segmentsThese data are derived from other data sources, no accuracy measurements or tests were conducted.

This was created using the ground (class = 2) lidar points and incorporating the breaklines.The DTMs were developed using LiDAR data. LiDAR is an acronym for LIght Detection And Ranging. Light detection and ranging is the science of using a laser to measure distances to specific points. A specially equipped airplane with positioning tools and LiDAR technology was used to measure the distance to the surface of the earth to determine ground elevation. The classified points were developed using data collected in April to May 2007. The LiDAR points, specialized software, and technology provide the ability to create a high precision three-dimensional digital elevation and/or terrain models (DEM/DTM). The use of LiDAR significantly reduces the cost for developing this information.The DTMs are intended to correspond to the orthometric heights of the bare surface of the county (no buildings or vegetation cover).

This was created using all points (excluding NOISE) from our 2007 LiDAR data without incorporating the breaklines. Merrick and Co. MARS (ver. 8.0.4, build 8185) software was used to create the GeoTIFF images.The DSMs were developed using LiDAR data. LiDAR is an acronym for LIght Detection And Ranging. Light detection and ranging is the science of using a laser to measure distances to specific points. A specially equipped airplane with positioning tools and LiDAR technology was used to measure the distance to the surface of the earth. The classified points were developed using data collected in April to May 2007. The LiDAR points, specialized software, and technology provide the ability to create a high precision three-dimensional digital elevation and/or terrain models (DEM/DTM) as well as digital surface models (DSM). The use of LiDAR significantly reduces the cost for developing this information.The DSMs are intended to correspond to the orthometric heights of the surface of the county including above ground features such as buildings, vegetation cover, utility structures, vehicles ... etc. DSM data are used by county agencies and others to study drainage issues such as flooding and erosion; contour generation; slope and aspect; and hill shade images. Elevation data and models are used in several different ways including:Visualization representations of the elevation data. Examples include:-	A hillshaded or shaded relief image-	An image representing slope-	An image representing aspectAnalysis of the elevation data and analytical products which can be generated. Examples include:-	Viewshed calculations for visibility and line-of-sight analysis-	Areas of highest Solar energy potential-	Uses in disaster management-	Industrial planning-	Calculation of cartographic contours-	Calculation of profiles along straight lines or line segmentsThese data are derived from other data sources, no accuracy measurements or tests were conducted.
