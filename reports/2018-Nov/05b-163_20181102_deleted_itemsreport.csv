The vector data is updated utilizing positions calculated from plats using coordinate geometry programs as well as aerial photos to approximate 'as built' locations. Platted, Public road centerlines are captured within this database. Private roads may not be shown.The centerlines usually represent the center of the physical roadway pavement. The center of physical roadway pavement may or may not represent the center of the road right of way. Road right of ways may taper or change width. This file has been further modified using several sources including survey centerlines and digitizing off aerial photos.
