It specifically includes updates to buildings identified in the course of the District of Columbia?s separate planimetric update, which noted structures known that were added, modified between or deleted between 2008 and 2010. Although it was intended to capture all new buildings irrespective of whether or not they were identified through the planimetric update process, it is likely that building changes not identified through the planimetric update process may not have been captured. It also uses an updated production process that addresses base elevation errors in the earlier product, where some buildings appeared to be taller than they were because the earlier production process had left them floating above the desired surface and this had been corrected by extending the walls of those structures down to the desired surface.This dataset contains full buildings (including facades and detailed rooftops.

structures originally captured from 2005 aerial imagery together with updates
based on 2010 aerial imagery. It was produced under contract to the District of
Columbia by CyberCity3D, Inc. using stereo imagery and a proprietary extraction
process that identifies roof polygon points and then creates entire structures
from them to form roof polygons.Attributes containing roof height, slope and
orientation are included. This dataset is an update to a previous 3D dataset
produced in 2006 using 2005 imagery. It specifically includes updates to
building rooftops identified in the course of the District of Columbia?s
separate planimetric update effort, which noted structures known that were
added, modified between or deleted between 2008 and 2010. Although it was
intended to capture all new buildings irrespective of whether or not they were
identified through the planimetric update process, it is likely that building
rooftop changes not identified through the planimetric update process may not
have been captured.?

This dataset contains
rooftops, including protrusions such as gabled windows, chimneys, elevator
utility rooms, etc.. There were also additional datasets delivered which broke
out those roof elements into separate files, as well as deliveries which included
complete 3D buildings with rooftops and facades. In many instances, row-houses
and other contiguous building rooftops could not be broken apart using the
process methodology and appear as a single structure. In some cases, entire
blocks of row houses are represented as a single feature, though visually they
can be distinguished easily. Additionally, the process captured small features,
such as canopy umbrellas and other structures as building rooftops and these
features may exist at various locations in the dataset.Many data gaps in the
earlier dataset (largely due to missing or reduced-resolution source imagery)
are corrected in this product. Based on comparison to DC?s available
planimetric datasets, there are still instances where particular structures are
omitted or not updated in the current product, but we believe that upwards of
99% of the District?s buildings are reflected in this dataset.All DC GIS data
is stored and exported in Maryland State Plane coordinates NAD 83 meters.

Due to the low altitude flown to capture the complete imagery for the 2015 sensory flight, there is incomplete aerial photography coverage around the White House and the U.S. Capitol. For these areas, 2013 imagery was merged seamlessly using the street centerlines to define the 2013 merged areas.

The digital imagery was used to create natural color digital orthophotography with 8cm pixel resolution. The final orthophotography deliverable products for this project consist of 328 ortho tiles at a scale of 1 to 2400. The tile dimensions are 800 meters by 800 meters.

Benchmarking is defined as tracking a building?s energy?and water use and using a standard metric to compare the building?s performance against past?performance and to its peers nationwide. These comparisons have been shown to drive energy?efficiency upgrades and increase occupancy rates and property values. The District of?Columbia has chosen U.S. EPA?s free, industry-standard ENERGY STAR? Portfolio Manager? tool?for benchmarking and reporting. DDOE is required to publicly disclose the ENERGY STAR??Benchmarking results for each privately owned building that is subject to the benchmarking?law, beginning with the 2nd year of benchmarking data for that building.

DC Fire/EMS partners in this effort are the American Heart Association, the DC Chamber of Commerce, the National Capital Chapter of the American Red Cross and Medtronic Physio-Control.

The Topological Faces Shapefile contains the attributes of each topological primitive face. Each face has a unique topological face identifier (TFID) value. Each face in the shapefile includes the key geographic area codes for almost all geographic areas for which the Census Bureau tabulates data for both the 2010 Census and Census 2000.
