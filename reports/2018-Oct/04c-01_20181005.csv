The program was established by 1986 legislation that allocates up to one percent of the District?s adjusted Capital Budget for the commission and acquisition of artwork. Our program gives opportunities for individuals to encounter art in parks, libraries, community centers, government offices, bridges and other public venues. We simultaneously enrich the daily lives of residents and visitors and give voice to artists. The collection includes more than 100 permanently sited and integrated works and 2,500 portable works in District offices. http://dcarts.dc.gov/service/public-artThe DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities recognizes the importance of remaining relevant in a city of competitive opportunities for residents who have at their disposal significant discretionary income for arts and cultural offerings.

The primary risk classifications used are the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event, the 0.2-percent-annual-chance flood event, and areas of minimal flood risk. The DFIRM Database is derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data, where available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The file is georeferenced to earth's surface using the UTM projection and coordinate system. The specifications for the horizontal control of DFIRM data files are consistent with those required for mapping at a scale of 1:12000. Insurance applications include enforcement of the mandatory purchase requirement of the Flood Disaster Protection Act, which ... requires the purchase of flood insurance by property owners who are being assisted by Federal programs or by Federally supervised, regulated or insured agencies or institutions in the acquisition or improvement of land facilities located or to be located in identified areas having special flood hazards, Section 2 (b) (4) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973. In addition to the identification of Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs), the risk zones shown on the FIRMs are the basis for the establishment of premium rates for flood coverage offered through the NFIP. The DFIRM Database presents the flood risk information depicted on the FIRM in a digital format suitable for use in electronic mapping applications.

This document describes the processes used to create the orthoimagery data produced for the District of Columbia from 2015 digital aerial photography.??It was flown in mid to Late?April, completed on?April 24, 2015.?? Due to the low altitude flown to capture the complete imagery for the 2015 sensory flight, there is incomplete aerial photography coverage around the White House and the U.S. Capitol. For these areas, 2013 imagery was merged seamlessly using the street centerlines to define the 2013 merged areas. This minimized distortion of features.The project area covers the entire District of Columbia which is approximately 69 square miles. The digital imagery was used to create natural color digital orthophotography with 8cm pixel resolution. The final orthophotography deliverable products for this project consist of 328 ortho tiles at a scale of 1 to 2400. The tile dimensions are 800 meters by 800 meters. A corresponding MrSid image was created by mosaicing the 328 ortho tiles together and compressing the image using an 80 to 1 compression ration.

Areas outside of P56 that are redacted have been merged with 2013 - resampled to 3 inch (from 6 inch). Past flights were flown at 6,000 feet.

The Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM) Database depicts flood risk information and supporting data used to develop the risk data. The primary risk classifications used are the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event, the 0.2-percent-annual-chance flood event, and areas of minimal flood risk. The DFIRM Database is derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data, where available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The file is georeferenced to earth's surface using the UTM projection and coordinate system. The specifications for the horizontal control of DFIRM data files are consistent with those required for mapping at a scale of 1:12000. Insurance applications include enforcement of the mandatory purchase requirement of the Flood Disaster Protection Act, which ... requires the purchase of flood insurance by property owners who are being assisted by Federal programs or by Federally supervised, regulated or insured agencies or institutions in the acquisition or improvement of land facilities located or to be located in identified areas having special flood hazards, Section 2 (b) (4) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973.

Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO). The project was funded by the United States Department of Commerce National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) directed NTIA to develop and maintain a comprehensive nationwide inventory map of broadband service capability and availability, and to make the map publicly available via the Internet. NTIA is collecting data from all 50 states, 5 territories, and the District of Columbia. Detailed information about this project can be found in the State Broadband Data and Development Grant Program Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) (http://www.ntia.doc.gov/frnotices/2009/FR_BroadbandMappingNOFA_090708.pdf) and subsequent clarifications. This data collection is to be conducted on a semi-annual basis over a five-year period. This data will attempts to reflect conditions in the field as of December 2009. The data is covered by nondisclosure agreements entered into by OCTO and broadband providers. The data contains COMMERCIAL / PROPRIETARY and CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The data is compiled solely for use by NTIA and cooperating federal agencies. Redistribution of the data in its raw form is prohibited. NTIA will use the data collected by grantees including the District of Columbia, in combination with other data sources, to create and publish online the National Broadband Map by February 17, 2011. The map will further educate consumers and businesses about broadband Internet availability, enable broadband Internet providers and investors to make better-informed decisions regarding the use of their private capital for future broadband investment, and inform the decisions of Federal, State, and local policymakers as they work to expand the benefits of broadband to all Americans.For the latest information, please visit https://www.broadbandmap.gov/",2015-02-27T21:17:20.000Z,http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/21213913e1ea415194a8b56321046b8e_19,https://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/rest/services/DCGIS_DATA/Utility_and_Communication_WebMercator/MapServer/19,"-77.1198964251,38.7915818465,-76.9090163369,38.9959674016",http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/21213913e1ea415194a8b56321046b8e_19

http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/14d9f44e81914b0cb9a7c622fe237a94_39,Tax Lots,"DC's Real Property Tax Administration defines assessment and taxation lots, often referred to as AT lots or simply tax lots.  These lots are strictly for real estate taxation purposes and normally defined under two circumstances: When property owners ask for their real property tax bills to be consolidated, after they have bought several contiguous record lots; this is called a combine;When part of a record lot is sold, but no new record lot is yet defined; this is called a split request. Tax lots are not determined by survey, and are therefore not official lots in the same way record lots are.  These lots are normally numbered between 800 and 1999within a square to differentiate them from record lots on the property tax maps.  When a tax lot is established by RPTA, an AT Plat is generated by RPTA and forwarded to the surveyor?s office. These AT Plats are not reviewed but simply filed by the Surveyor; they do not comply with the standards required of subdivision plats, and are not recorded.  Tax Lots are not normally acceptable when applying for building permits and must be converted to Record Lots through the normal subdivision process involving the D.C. Surveyor?s Office before permits will be issued.  The only exception is if the lot does not face a public street.  Furthermore, at the time of their creation and platting, there is no review made of tax lots for compliance with D.C. Zoning, Subdivisions or any other ordinances.  These lots are simply pieces of property, owned by somebody, described in deeds, for which tax bills are sent and real estate taxes are collected by the city. Some Record Lots also function in this capacity.  Geographically, tax lots typically overlay layers such as record lots or sometimes reservations.  There are known instances where tax lots do not overlay these types of layers.  Up until approximately 1972, AT lots were only created by the Tax Assessor out of lands that had been previously Record Lots at some point in their history.  For a short period of time in the early to mid 1970?s, a decision was made to start eliminating fractional parcels (see definition below) and make them all into AT lots.  The intent was to do away with Parcels altogether and have all properties in the city be either tax lots or record lots.  By doing this, they converted unsubdivided parcels into AT lots where no underlying record lot exists. There is often little or no historical source information about these types of transactions therefore vectorizing them often required vast amounts of research.Created as part of the DC Geographic Information System (DC GIS) for the D.C.

3D rooftops for the District of Columbia in ESRI multipatch format. It includes
structures originally captured from 2005 aerial imagery together with updates
based on 2010 aerial imagery. It was produced under contract to the District of
Columbia by CyberCity3D, Inc. using stereo imagery and a proprietary extraction
process that identifies roof polygon points and then creates entire structures
from them to form roof polygons.Attributes containing roof height, slope and
orientation are included. This dataset is an update to a previous 3D dataset
produced in 2006 using 2005 imagery. It specifically includes updates to
building rooftops identified in the course of the District of Columbia?s
separate planimetric update effort, which noted structures known that were
added, modified between or deleted between 2008 and 2010. Although it was
intended to capture all new buildings irrespective of whether or not they were
identified through the planimetric update process, it is likely that building
rooftop changes not identified through the planimetric update process may not
have been captured.?

This dataset contains
rooftops, including protrusions such as gabled windows, chimneys, elevator
utility rooms, etc.. There were also additional datasets delivered which broke
out those roof elements into separate files, as well as deliveries which included
complete 3D buildings with rooftops and facades. In many instances, row-houses
and other contiguous building rooftops could not be broken apart using the
process methodology and appear as a single structure. In some cases, entire
blocks of row houses are represented as a single feature, though visually they
can be distinguished easily. Additionally, the process captured small features,
such as canopy umbrellas and other structures as building rooftops and these
features may exist at various locations in the dataset.Many data gaps in the
earlier dataset (largely due to missing or reduced-resolution source imagery)
are corrected in this product. Based on comparison to DC?s available
planimetric datasets, there are still instances where particular structures are
omitted or not updated in the current product, but we believe that upwards of
99% of the District?s buildings are reflected in this dataset.All DC GIS data
is stored and exported in Maryland State Plane coordinates NAD 83 meters.

Although the primary purpose of the stop and frisk incident report is to collect information on forcible stops or frisks, officers frequently use this report to document non-forcible stops. Thus, the incident type ?stop and frisk? may include non-forcible stops, forcible stops, and frisks.Each row of information in the attached dataset represents an individual associated with a stop and frisk incident. Not all individuals of an incident may have been stopped or frisked. For example, two individuals may have been associated with a stop or frisk incident but only one person may have been stopped. The other person may include a witness. Moreover, two individuals may have been stopped where only one person is frisked. A ?stop? is a temporary detention of a person for the purpose of determining whether probable cause exists to arrest a person. A ?frisk? is a limited protective search on a person to determine the presence of concealed weapons and/or dangerous instruments.

Their boundaries were also depicted (in many cases approximated), in large books in DCRA's Office of the Surveyor.  Until the late 1960s, building permits were routinely issued by the city for new construction on Parcels, but today all Parcels, like Tax Lots, must be converted into subdivision Lots of Record before permits will be issued for exterior work.

Typically, these lots are numbered 1 through 799 with no number being used more than once in a Square.  Exceptions to this rule:When the 1-799 range has been exhausted within a square, the Surveyor?s Office assigns numbers from 1200 or may even use 8000 and aboveFor reasons unknown, 42 Squares have record lot numbers greater than 799 but less than 1200Additionally, in most case scenario?s, a piece of property must be a Record Lot before a building permit will be issued for that site in the District of Columbia, and all proposed Record Lots are carefully reviewed by Zoning Administration officials for compliance with the city?s Zoning Ordinances.  Other agencies that review new record lots besides OS are Office of Zoning, Office of Planning, the Dept. of Public Works, Historic Preservation and DDOT.Record lots are defined only when requested by property owners, normally when they are seeking a building permit.  Record lots are recorded in Plat Books and Subdivision Books in the Office of the Surveyor. These documents are bound volumes of historical representations of the locations of property lines, and they include record dimensions, though typically no bearings of lines.  These lots are located within squares, which usually correspond to one or two city blocks. Certain record lots can also be classified as ?of-lots?.  An Of-Lot is the D.C. Surveyor?s Office term for describing ?Remaining/Part of Original Lot X?In the record lot feature class, if a domain value of 1 resides in the ?OF_LOT? field, you can assume that at one time the original lot was modified.

Office of the Surveyor (OS) - DC Surveyor. They are official, platted, recorded subdivision lots created by the D.C Surveyor?s Office in compliance with the Subdivision Ordinance of the District of Columbia (must have public street frontage etc). Typically, these lots are numbered 1 through 799 with no number being used more than once in a Square. Exceptions to this rule:When the 1-799 range has been exhausted within a square, the Surveyor?s Office assigns numbers from 1200 or may even use 8000 and aboveFor reasons unknown, 42 Squares have record lot numbers greater than 799 but less than 1200Additionally, in most case scenario?s, a piece of property must be a Record Lot before a building permit will be issued for that site in the District of Columbia, and all proposed Record Lots are carefully reviewed by Zoning Administration officials for compliance with the city?s Zoning Ordinances. Other agencies that review new record lots besides OS are Office of Zoning, Office of Planning, the Dept. of Public Works, Historic Preservation and DDOT.Record lots are defined only when requested by property owners, normally when they are seeking a building permit. Record lots are recorded in Plat Books and Subdivision Books in the Office of the Surveyor. These documents are bound volumes of historical representations of the locations of property lines, and they include record dimensions, though typically no bearings of lines. These lots are located within squares, which usually correspond to one or two city blocks. Certain record lots can also be classified as ?of-lots?. An Of-Lot is the D.C. Surveyor?s Office term for describing ?Remaining/Part of Original Lot X?In the record lot feature class, if a domain value of 1 resides in the ?OF_LOT? field, you can assume that at one time the original lot was modified.

These have been merged with Census poverty data to estimate how much of the population within these areas is food insecure (below 185% of the federal poverty line in addition to living in a low food access area). Office of Planning GIS followed several steps to create this layer, including: transit analysis, to eliminate areas of the District within a 10-minute walk of a grocery store; non-residential analysis, to eliminate areas of the District which do not contain residents and cannot classify as low food access areas (such as parks and the National Mall); and Census tract division, to estimate population and poverty rates within the newly created polygon boundaries. Fields contained in this layer include:Intermediary calculation fields for the aforementioned analysis.PartPop2: The total population estimated to live within the low food access area polygon (derived from Census tract population, assuming even distribution across the polygon after removing non-residential areas, followed by the removal of population living within a grocery store radius.)PrtOver185: The portion of PartPop2 which is estimated to have household income above 185% of the federal poverty line (the food secure population)PrtUnd185: The portion of PartPop2 which is estimated to have household income below 185% of the federal poverty line (the food insecure population)PercentUnd185: A calculated field showing PrtUnd185 as a percent of PartPop2. This is the percent of the population in the polygon which is food insecure (both living in a low food access area and below 185% of the federal poverty line).?Note that the polygon representing Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling was removed from this analysis. While technically classifying as a low food access area based on the OP Grocery Stores layer (since the JBAB Commissary, which only serves military members, is not included in that layer), it is recognized that those who do live on the base have access to the commissary for grocery needs.Last updated November 2017.",2018-03-19T16:37:09.000Z,http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/9b4355a8e1e345ea8350b77516163dd4_61,https://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/rest/services/DCGIS_DATA/Public_Service_WebMercator/MapServer/61,"-77.115984,38.803127,-76.909262,38.995809",http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/9b4355a8e1e345ea8350b77516163dd4_61

Due to technology advances, expanding user base needs, and aging data, DC GIS acquired new LIDAR data in spring 2015 to establish a more thorough and better quality core LIDAR dataset The LiDAR data products are suitable for 1 foot (or less) contour generation.Intensity images generated from the RPC data for the DC OCTO 2015 LiDAR project covering approximately 80 square miles, in which its extents cover Arlington County in Washington DC. Intensity is a measure, collected for every point, of the return strength of the laser pulse that generated the point. It is based, in part, on the reflectivity of the object struck by the laser pulse.

Please refer to the common ownership polygon layer in http://data.dc.gov for the most current data on ownership.Property Owner Points. This dataset contains points that represent the approximate location of real property lots within the District of Columbia. Each property point is generated based on a corresponding record maintained within the Office of Tax and Revenue (OTR) Real Property Tax Administration's (RPTA) real property database. Each point contains the full attribution of database fields derived from ITS public release extract. The initial data conversion effort was begun in 1997 as a means to provide RPTA with a digital mapping system which could be maintained to reflect ongoing changes to property lots and ownership. The initial step was to scan RPTA tax square maps from aperture cards at an effective paper resolution of 400 DPI. The resulting images were then georeferenced to DC's 0.2-meter resolution 1995 digital orthophotos. During the georeferencing process, the images were not warped; they were simply scaled and rotated to best fit the orthophotos. The DC tax assessor provided a database of active tax accounts which were placed interactively by an operator using the georeferenced square image and the orthophoto. Centroids were placed on the primary structure visible in the orthophoto within the raster property polygon. The placement was performed within ArcView 3.2 using a customized data production application. Accounts which could not be placed in the first pass were then reviewed by another operator to attempt to find their correct location. The placed points were QC'd through a spatial overlay with the square index to assure a match between the square field value within the property database and the actual square polygon into which the point was placed. Spot checking was then performed to confirm that the centroids fell within the correct raster lot. The centroids were delivered to OTR as a single citywide AutoCAD DWG file. Attribute features with square, suffix, and lot numbers (SSLs) were included as an AutoCAD block.",2015-02-27T21:10:00.000Z,http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/5564f65828844695b3e970ba3aa22577_27,https://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/rest/services/DCGIS_DATA/Property_and_Land_WebMercator/MapServer/27,"-77.115526,38.802442,-76.909271,38.995599",http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/5564f65828844695b3e970ba3aa22577_27

http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/4309de32613844d8a45ca40c21c0d73b_22,Tax Lot Points,"Tax Lot points. DC's Real Property Tax Administration defines assessment and taxation lots, often referred to as AT lots or simply tax lots. These lots are strictly for real estate taxation purposes and normally defined under two circumstances: When property owners ask for their real property tax bills to be consolidated, after they have bought several contiguous record lots; this is called a combine;When part of a record lot is sold, but no new record lot is yet defined; this is called a split request. Tax lots are not determined by survey, and are therefore not official lots in the same way record lots are. These lots are normally numbered between 800 and 1999within a square to differentiate them from record lots on the property tax maps. When a tax lot is established by RPTA, an AT Plat is generated by RPTA and forwarded to the surveyor?s office. These AT Plats are not reviewed but simply filed by the Surveyor; they do not comply with the standards required of subdivision plats, and are not recorded. Tax Lots are not normally acceptable when applying for building permits and must be converted to Record Lots through the normal subdivision process involving the D.C. Surveyor?s Office before permits will be issued. The only exception is if the lot does not face a public street. Furthermore, at the time of their creation and platting, there is no review made of tax lots for compliance with D.C. Zoning, Subdivisions or any other ordinances. These lots are simply pieces of property, owned by somebody, described in deeds, for which tax bills are sent and real estate taxes are collected by the city. Some Record Lots also function in this capacity. Geographically, tax lots typically overlay layers such as record lots or sometimes reservations. There are known instances where tax lots do not overlay these types of layers. Up until approximately 1972, AT lots were only created by the Tax Assessor out of lands that had been previously Record Lots at some point in their history. For a short period of time in the early to mid 1970?s, a decision was made to start eliminating fractional parcels (see definition below) and make them all into AT lots. The intent was to do away with Parcels altogether and have all properties in the city be either tax lots or record lots. By doing this, they converted unsubdivided parcels into AT lots where no underlying record lot exists. There is often little or no historical source information about these types of transactions therefore vectorizing them often required vast amounts of research.Created as part of the DC Geographic Information System (DC GIS) for the D.C.

http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/3a9e6d16d7374b5b9740888edc12ac13_44,Condo Approval Lots,"Condo lots are individual lots for each condominium. The lot numbers normally range from 2000-6999. These condo lots are not geographically defined other than being within a air rights, record, tax or a combination of lots that has one or more condo buildings within it. A condo regime number is assigned to each residential Condo application or Article of Confederation regardless of how many buildings there are at any one site. The Regime number starts with a 1, 2, or 3 depending upon where the condo is located and where they fall in the tri-annual assessment process of RPTA. All numbers after the first are consecutive. RPTA maintains the master list of Regime numbers for residential properties. Commercial condos are not associated with a Regime number and in order to properly track all condos, a unique Regime number was created. RPTA then establishes individual accounts for each condominium unit and assigns a condo lot number to that account. RPTA maintains the master list of Regime numbers and their relationship to approved condos. There are roughly 66571 condo lots and there associations are as follows: 49486 condos were approved for record lots, 16867 were approved for tax lots, 2817 were approved for air rights lots, and 2600 were approved for both air rights and tax lots. The CondoPly layer was created to assist users in visualizing the relationship between ground surface lots (Record Lots), overlay lots (Air Rights  Tax Lots), and the associated Condos. When Condos are approved for ground lots, those lots remain in the production (active) layer and attributes updated to reflect the new condos. When Condos are approved for overlay lots, those lots are killed (dead lots) and archived to their respective history layer. Condo dwellings can also be queried city-wide via the individual VPM layers (active Record lots, dead Air Rights  Tax lots) where the value in the ?UNDERLIES_CONDO? field is equal to 1.Created as part of the DC Geographic Information System (DC GIS) for the D.C.

There are roughly 4896 active squares.  A Square is similar to a city block. Squares were numbered starting at 1 and are currently in the 6000 series. Not all squares are active. A common cause of squares becoming inactive has been through street closing and combining squares. When the squares are combined usually the lower square number is killed and the higher square number is used for the combined square.  For example if squares 1 and 2 are combined, square 1 is killed and the combination becomes square 2.Spatial locations:Each Square is an Island, alone unto itself.  There is not now, and has never been, any citywide Survey Coordinate System in D.C.  Most squares are unrelated to other Squares by ?Measured.? They are related by Record.  Street width is approximate. You cannot rely on the published official street widths to set up property lines or determine right-of-way. There is digital scan information available from DDOT regarding Right-of-Way.  Some Squares are divided by streets. That is, the same Square continues on the other side of the street.  Since there is no citywide Survey Coordinate System, squares were placed in their approximate location.

Squares were numbered starting at 1 and are currently in the 6000 series. Not all squares are active. A common cause of squares becoming inactive has been through street closing and combining squares. When the squares are combined usually the lower square number is killed and the higher square number is used for the combined square. For example if squares 1 and 2 are combined, square 1 is killed and the combination becomes square 2.Spatial locations:Each Square is an Island, alone unto itself. There is not now, and has never been, any citywide Survey Coordinate System in D.C. Most squares are unrelated to other Squares by ?Measured.? They are related by Record. Street width is approximate. You cannot rely on the published official street widths to set up property lines or determine right-of-way. There is digital scan information available from DDOT regarding Right-of-Way. Some Squares are divided by streets. That is, the same Square continues on the other side of the street. Since there is no citywide Survey Coordinate System, squares were placed in their approximate location.

Urban Tree Canopy (UTC) Assessment for Washington, DC. This dataset consists of UTC metrics summarized at the parcel level. The UTC Assessment is a top-down approach to analyzing the urban forest. Its purpose is to integrate high resolution land cover data with other GIS datasets to produce a set of detailed metrics on the urban forest that allow decision makers to know how much tree canopy currently exists (termed Existing UTC) and amount of land where is it biophysically feasible to establish tree canopy on (termed Possible UTC). Existing UTC is determined by extracting all features classified as tree canopy from a high resolution land cover dataset. Possible UTC is determined by identifying land where canopy could possibly exist and includes two subcategories: Possible-impervious and Possible-vegetation. Possible-impervious consists of all impervious land that, through modification, could support tree canopy. Examples of such features are sidewalks, minor driveways (through overhanging coverage), and playgrounds. Possible-vegetation consists of all land that is low-lying vegetation, primarily grass or shrubs, which could conceivably be converted to support tree canopy. Examples of such features include residential lawns and playing fields. Possible-vegetation also includes bare earth where no vegetation or impervious surfaces currently exist. UTC metrics do not serve to address the issues of where it is socially desirable or financially feasible to plant trees. Rather, the UTC metrics serve as the basis for beginning to form answers to these questions. UTC metrics are presented in the attribute table as both absolute area (in square meters) and relative area (percentage of land area) per parcel. For example, an Existing UTC Area (UTC_E_A) value of 13,677 and an Existing UTC Percentage (UTC_E_P) of 21.8 indicate that for the parcel in question the area of Existing UTC is 13,677 (in square meters) and 21.8% of that feature is tree canopy. Key parcel attributes have been maintained to assist in joining this table to the original parcel layer. The land cover dataset used to derive the UTC metrics for this dataset was generated from Quickbird color-infrared imagery acquired on September 7, 2006.

Note that, because many locations are small (or indoors) and could not be located through this satellite view, and because acreage as calculated by these polygons differs, sometimes significantly, from producers' self-reported acreage (indicating the presence of other, less visible growing space, or out-of-date satellite imagery), this layer should not be considered complete and should be used for internal purposes only. Fields include:Company: Company or organization in charge of the site.GrowingAddress: Address at which growing and food production operations take place.Status: Type of organization (for-profit or non-profit).Acreage: Number of acres under cultivation at site.

http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/b868ff28f5364f5cad595d6249e6d9fc_38,Tax Lots (Historical),"Historical Tax Lots. DC's Real Property Tax Administration defines assessment and taxation lots, often referred to as AT lots or simply tax lots. These lots are strictly for real estate taxation purposes and normally defined under two circumstances: When property owners ask for their real property tax bills to be consolidated, after they have bought several contiguous record lots; this is called a combine;When part of a record lot is sold, but no new record lot is yet defined; this is called a split request. Tax lots are not determined by survey, and are therefore not official lots in the same way record lots are. These lots are normally numbered between 800 and 1999within a square to differentiate them from record lots on the property tax maps. When a tax lot is established by RPTA, an AT Plat is generated by RPTA and forwarded to the surveyor?s office. These AT Plats are not reviewed but simply filed by the Surveyor; they do not comply with the standards required of subdivision plats, and are not recorded. Tax Lots are not normally acceptable when applying for building permits and must be converted to Record Lots through the normal subdivision process involving the D.C. Surveyor?s Office before permits will be issued. The only exception is if the lot does not face a public street. Furthermore, at the time of their creation and platting, there is no review made of tax lots for compliance with D.C. Zoning, Subdivisions or any other ordinances. These lots are simply pieces of property, owned by somebody, described in deeds, for which tax bills are sent and real estate taxes are collected by the city. Some Record Lots also function in this capacity. Geographically, tax lots typically overlay layers such as record lots or sometimes reservations. There are known instances where tax lots do not overlay these types of layers. Up until approximately 1972, AT lots were only created by the Tax Assessor out of lands that had been previously Record Lots at some point in their history. For a short period of time in the early to mid 1970?s, a decision was made to start eliminating fractional parcels (see definition below) and make them all into AT lots. The intent was to do away with Parcels altogether and have all properties in the city be either tax lots or record lots. By doing this, they converted unsubdivided parcels into AT lots where no underlying record lot exists. There is often little or no historical source information about these types of transactions therefore vectorizing them often required vast amounts of research.Created as part of the DC Geographic Information System (DC GIS) for the D.C.

They are official, platted, recorded subdivision lots created by the D.C Surveyor?s Office in compliance with the Subdivision Ordinance of the District of Columbia (must have public street frontage etc).  Typically, these lots are numbered 1 through 799 with no number being used more than once in a Square.  Exceptions to this rule:When the 1-799 range has been exhausted within a square, the Surveyor?s Office assigns numbers from 1200 or may even use 8000 and aboveFor reasons unknown, 42 Squares have record lot numbers greater than 799 but less than 1200Additionally, in most case scenario?s, a piece of property must be a Record Lot before a building permit will be issued for that site in the District of Columbia, and all proposed Record Lots are carefully reviewed by Zoning Administration officials for compliance with the city?s Zoning Ordinances.  Other agencies that review new record lots besides OS are Office of Zoning, Office of Planning, the Dept. of Public Works, Historic Preservation and DDOT.Record lots are defined only when requested by property owners, normally when they are seeking a building permit.  Record lots are recorded in Plat Books and Subdivision Books in the Office of the Surveyor. These documents are bound volumes of historical representations of the locations of property lines, and they include record dimensions, though typically no bearings of lines.  These lots are located within squares, which usually correspond to one or two city blocks. Certain record lots can also be classified as ?of-lots?.  An Of-Lot is the D.C. Surveyor?s Office term for describing ?Remaining/Part of Original Lot X?In the record lot feature class, if a domain value of 1 resides in the ?OF_LOT? field, you can assume that at one time the original lot was modified.

The Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM) Database depicts flood risk information and supporting data used to develop the risk data. The primary risk classifications used are the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event, the 0.2-percent-annual-chance flood event, and areas of minimal flood risk. The DFIRM Database is derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data, where available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The file is georeferenced to earth's surface using the UTM projection and coordinate system. The specifications for the horizontal control of DFIRM data files are consistent with those required for mapping at a scale of 1:12000. Insurance applications include enforcement of the mandatory purchase requirement of the Flood Disaster Protection Act, which ... requires the purchase of flood insurance by property owners who are being assisted by Federal programs or by Federally supervised, regulated or insured agencies or institutions in the acquisition or improvement of land facilities located or to be located in identified areas having special flood hazards, Section 2 (b) (4) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973. In addition to the identification of Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs), the risk zones shown on the FIRMs are the basis for the establishment of premium rates for flood coverage offered through the NFIP. The DFIRM Database presents the flood risk information depicted on the FIRM in a digital format suitable for use in electronic mapping applications. The DFIRM database is a subset of the Digital FIS database that serves to archive the information collected during the FIS.",2015-02-27T20:55:38.000Z,http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/79942bac8860405085408aad3bf77790_7,https://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/rest/services/DCGIS_DATA/Environment_WebMercator/MapServer/7,"-77.1166239155,38.7931733142,-76.9115661866,38.9888388508",http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/79942bac8860405085408aad3bf77790_7
