HRVs are developed to protect human health for a specified length of exposure (e.g., one hour, 13 weeks, a lifetime). In cases where an HRV promulgated using the public process described in the Administrative Procedures Act (Minnesota Statutes Chapter 14) was not available as a reference level, we instead used the recommended exposure limit (REL) from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) or the permissible exposure limit (PEL) from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), selecting the most conservative level.

By clicking on a point, a user may learn more about an individual property's characteristics, energy efficiency, and water use from prior reporting years when available. Public buildings from the City of Minneapolis, Hennepin County, the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board, and Minneapolis Public Schools were phased in first and therefore show data for 2012-2015.  The largest private buildings 100,000 sqft and greater, show publicly available data starting in 2014.  The remaining category, private buildings between 50,000-100,000 sqft in size, data is made publicly available starting with the 2015 dataset.  

The toggleable metrics highlight the most summary information of building energy and water efficiency:

ENERGY STAR score - The 1-100 ENERGY STAR score was developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and provides a metric for comparison with other similar buildings across the country.  The score accounts for differences in climate, occupancy and operating hours.  A score of 50 represents median energy performance, while a score of 75 or better indicates a building is a top performer.  The higher the score, the more efficient the building. 

Energy Use Intensity (EUI) - The metric used for comparing buildings in Energy Star, EUI expresses a building?s energy use relative to its size. In this report it is expressed as kBtu/ft?, and is calculated by taking the total energy consumed in a year (in kBtu) and dividing it by the floor area of the building (in ft?).  The lower the kBtu/ft?, the lower the energy consumption.

Weather-normalized Energy Use Intensity - Energy use is adjusted to account year-to-year weather differences, allowing for comparison of a building to itself over time. Through this procedure, the energy in a given year is adjusted to express the energy that would have been consumed under 30-year average weather conditions.  Weather-normalized EUI also uses the kBtu/ft? unit.

Technology Survey Data

Thanks to the 3,015 residents for their participation,
the third year's results are in on a survey the City of Minneapolis conducted
to understand how Minneapolis residents use computers, mobile devices and the
Internet. Access to computers and the Internet, along with the skills to use
these tools is critical as technology becomes more and more a part of our daily
lives and is integrated in our economic, educational, health, and workforce
systems. ?The results will inform priorities for the City?s digital
inclusion initiatives, and help engage businesses, neighborhood and community
groups, public sector partners, and funders to more effectively address
community technology and economic development needs. In addition, the survey
provides data to measure changes in the community over time. 

The City of Minneapolis Information Technology
Department contracted with National Research Center, Inc. (NRC) to conduct a
survey of residents to inform the City?s efforts to overcome the digital equity
gap between individuals and groups in their access to and use and knowledge of
information and communication technologies. This is the third iteration of the
Minneapolis Community Technology Survey; the first was conducted in 2012 and
the second in 2013.Summary of Data Fields:Field 1 ? Overall percentage of

Rental Property Minneapolis
requires that every rental dwelling, including single-family rental dwellings
and rental units in owner-occupied duplexes, and rooming and shared-bath units
(unless they are in a licensed lodging house) must have a rental
license.?The number of locations shown on the map above reflects the
unique amount of dwellings in the City of Minneapolis with rental licenses, not
the unique amount of rental licenses. Why License Rental Properties? The intent
of the rental license ordinance is to: Promote the health, safety, and welfare
of the general public. Assure preservation of the existing housing supply. Help
maintain property values. Work toward eliminating substandard and deteriorating
rental housing. Maintain a living environment that contributes to healthful
individual and family living. For more information on the licensing process,
call 311 or outside Minneapolis city limits call (612) 673-3000. ? Note:
All owner and applicant information is provided from the rental license
application submitted by the applicant.??

resources provided through the Great Streets Neighborhood Business District
Program. Eligible areas were designated in The Minneapolis Plan for Sustainable
Growth and consist of Activity Centers, Commercial Nodes, Commercial Corridors,
and LRT Station Areas. Exact parcel boundaries of Activity Centers and
Commercial Nodes are identified in The Minneapolis Plan. Commercial Corridor
areas are generally defined as a one block radius from designated corridors.
LRT Station Areas are defined as a ? mile radius from each LRT station outside
of downtown. Some staff discretion was used in determining precise boundaries
for Commercial Corridors and LRT Station Areas in cases where roadways or other
natural boundaries made exact definitions unclear.

?

Each area is categorized based on a number of metrics used
to determine its economic health and opportunity. Varying levels of Great
Streets program resources are available, based on this categorization. These
categories are defined as:

?

Intervene: Areas that are experiencing weak development
interest or significant obstacles to attaining the City?s commercial
development or business investment goals.

Support: Areas showing signs of strength, but that remain
fragile and have some barriers to market development and business investment.

Monitor: Areas with strong market development and business
activity.
