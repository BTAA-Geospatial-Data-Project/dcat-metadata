resources provided through the Great Streets Neighborhood Business District
Program. Eligible areas were designated in The Minneapolis Plan for Sustainable
Growth and consist of Activity Centers, Commercial Nodes, Commercial Corridors,
and LRT Station Areas. Exact parcel boundaries of Activity Centers and
Commercial Nodes are identified in The Minneapolis Plan. Commercial Corridor
areas are generally defined as a one block radius from designated corridors.
LRT Station Areas are defined as a ? mile radius from each LRT station outside
of downtown. Some staff discretion was used in determining precise boundaries
for Commercial Corridors and LRT Station Areas in cases where roadways or other
natural boundaries made exact definitions unclear.

?

Each area is categorized based on a number of metrics used
to determine its economic health and opportunity. Varying levels of Great
Streets program resources are available, based on this categorization. These
categories are defined as:

?

Intervene: Areas that are experiencing weak development
interest or significant obstacles to attaining the City?s commercial
development or business investment goals.

Support: Areas showing signs of strength, but that remain
fragile and have some barriers to market development and business investment.

Monitor: Areas with strong market development and business
activity.
