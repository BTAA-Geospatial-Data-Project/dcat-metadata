The DFIRM Database is derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data, where available.

The specifications for the horizontal control of DFIRM data files are consistent with those required for mapping at a scale of 1:12000.

Led by the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development (DMPED) in conjunction with the Office of Planning (OP) and the District Department of Transportation (DDOT), Great Streets has grown into a multi-year, multi-agency program that utilizes public actions and resources to leverage private investment in retail, office space, housing, and cultural facilities across the District. The Government of the District of Columbia through the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development (DMPED) administers the Great Streets Retail Small Business Reimbursement Grants, which are competitive grants of up to $50,000 for qualified small business owners who wish to improve their place of business. The purpose of the grant program is to support existing small businesses, attract new businesses, increase the District's tax base, create new job opportunities for District residents, and transform emerging commercial corridors into thriving and inviting neighborhood centers.
