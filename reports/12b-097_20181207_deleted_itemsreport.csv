http://data-lakecountyil.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/d59b21f762c648869d4df3b3cb4d6ad4_0,Lake County Wetland Inventory,"Download In State Plane Projection Here.?The Lake County Wetland Inventory (LCWI) maps natural and artificial 
wetlands meeting definitions established by the federal agencies who 
work with the Lake County Geographic Information System staff to 
periodically review and update it. These agencies include the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service and the United States Army Corps of Engineers.

        The 1989 federal wetland delineation standards for offsite 
wetland mapping are used. This data was last published in March of 1993.
 This update includes changes to the previous version of LCWI including:
 adjust current wetland boundaries to omit development, including roads;
 to fine tune boundary placement where that was intended by the original
 delineation, in some cases, adjust the wetland to photographic features
 / signature; delete wetlands which the committee decided were mapped in
 error - for example, trees which were mistaken for wet areas; create 
polygons for newly delineated artificial wetlands; and newly delineated 
wetlands or farmed wetlands caused by the continued deterioration of the
 agricultural drain tile system and increased runoff due to 
urbanization.

        The LCWI is a useful tool for general planning and review 
purposes, but it does not take the place of an on-site delineation by a 
certified wetland specialist.

        High resolution (1 = 100') orthorectified aerial imagery 
captured in April 2002 was used as the base for this update. Other data 
used as reference for this update include: 2004 SOIL SURVEY GEOGRAPHIC 
(SSURGO) DATABASE FOR LAKE COUNTY, IL - U.S. Department of Agriculture, 
Natural Resources Conservation Service; HYDROLOGY2002 - Lake County 
GIS/Map Division; 2' topography (CONTOURS) - Lake County GIS/Map 
Division; and various years of historical aerial photography for 
clarification. By using the more recent higher resolution photography, 
the resulting updated wetland boundaries are more accurate then the 
original boundaries published in 1993.",2016-09-30T20:07:15.000Z,2018-10-17T21:39:42.416Z,http://data-lakecountyil.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/d59b21f762c648869d4df3b3cb4d6ad4_0,https://services3.arcgis.com/HESxeTbDliKKvec2/arcgis/rest/services/Lake_County_Wetland_Inventory/FeatureServer/0,"-88.19982978057534,42.152363629031214,-87.7558913142488,42.495831319293764"

Part 404(b)(1) of the Clean Water Act authorizes the USEPA and the US Army Corps of Engineers
 to identify in advance of specific permit requests aquatic sites which 
will be considered as areas generally unsuitable for disposal of dredged
 or fill material. This process is called an Advanced Identification or 
ADID. Under the ADID process identification of an area as generally 
unsuitable for fill does not prohibit applications for permits to fill 
in these areas. Therefore the ADID designation of unsuitability is 
advisory not regulatory.

        An ADID designation lets a potential applicant know in 
advance that a proposal to fill such a site is not likely to be 
consistent with the 404(b)(1) guidelines, and the USEPA will probably 
request permit denial.

        ADID wetland information is also useful in watershed 
planning, land use planning, public land acquisition programs, natural 
resource studies and other purposes.

        The wetland selection criteria and methodology are documented
 in the publication entitled Advanced Identification (ADID) Study, Lake
 County, Illinois. Final Report, November 1992 which is included in 
this download.

These data were developed from LIDAR data obtained between April 16, 2007 and May 07, 2007, and further supplemented by break lines collected from aerial photography taken at the same time. The contours and the aerial photography meet National Map Accuracy Standards for a 1 inch = 100 foot product. The contours have been created to be cartographically pleasing, as such some generalization has been introduced as expected. The contours have been tested against the original LIDAR points and conforms to the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) Specifications and Standards Committee, 1990, ASPRS Accuracy Standards for Large-Scale Maps, CLASS 1 map accuracy. The vertical datum is the North American Vertical Datum of 1988.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers?Engineering and Design Manual for Photogrammetric Production?recommends that data intended for this usage scale be used for any of the following purposes: route location, preliminary alignment and design, preliminary project planning, hydraulic sections, rough earthwork estimates, or high-gradient terrain / low unit cost earthwork excavation estimates. The manual does not recommend that these data be used for final design, excavation and grading plans, earthwork computations for bid estimates or contract measurement and payment.Contour data is used by county agencies to study drainage issues such as flooding and erosion. Customers interested in the actual LiDAR data may download it at no cost from the USGS Center for LiDAR Information Coordination and Knowledge.These files are tiled by PLSS section and grouped by township and format for easier download.
