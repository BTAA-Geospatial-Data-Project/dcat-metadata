Fugro EarthData, Inc. acquired 151 flight lines in eight lifts on February 6, 7, 9, 13, 15, and 16, 2011; in tidal areas, data was collected within 2 hours (before or after) of mean low tide. The data was divided into 1500 by 1500 meter cells that serve as the tiling scheme. LiDAR data collection was performed with a Piper Navajo twin engine aircraft, utilizing a Leica ALS60 MPiA sensor, collecting multiple return x, y, and z as well as intensity data. LiDAR data is remotely sensed high-resolution elevation data collected by an airborne collection platform. This data of the Pocomoke and Atlantic Coastal Watersheds in Maryland, was collected at sufficient resolution to provide a nominal point spacing of 0.70 meters for collected points. Up to 4 returns were recorded for each pulse in addition to an intensity value.Last Updated: 2011Feature Service Link:?https://lidar.geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Worcester/MD_worcester_hillshade_m/ImageServer",2018-01-25T20:41:01.000Z,2018-02-06T15:52:17.111Z,http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/7fa518f9992d4721b8a9247d5b21cb4d,https://lidar.geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Worcester/MD_worcester_hillshade_m/ImageServer,"-75.6849,37.9776,-75.0468,38.4673"

This task is for a high resolution data set of lidar covering approximately 1,845 square miles. The lidar data was acquired and processed under the requirements identified in this task order. Lidar data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. The final products include classified LAS, one (1) meter pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format, and 8-bit intensity images. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Additional deliverables include hydrologic breakline data, control data, tile index, lidar processing and survey reports in PDF format, FGDC metadata files for each data deliverable in .xml format, and LAS swath data. Ground conditions: Water at normal levels; no unusual inundation; no snow; leaf off. Coastal tiles 18SVH065720 and 8SVH095690 contain no lidar points as they exist completely in water. A DEM IMG was generated for these two tiles as the digitized hydro breakline assumed the data extent in the area.

The project area consists of approximately 500 square miles. The project design of the LiDAR data acquisition was developed to support a nominal post spacing of 0.70 meters. Fugro EarthData, Inc. acquired 151 flight lines in eight lifts on February 6, 7, 9, 13, 15, and 16, 2011; in tidal areas, data was collected within 2 hours (before or after) of mean low tide. The data was divided into 1500 by 1500 meter cells that serve as the tiling scheme. LiDAR data collection was performed with a Piper Navajo twin engine aircraft, utilizing a Leica ALS60 MPiA sensor, collecting multiple return x, y, and z as well as intensity data. LiDAR data is remotely sensed high-resolution elevation data collected by an airborne collection platform. This data of the Pocomoke and Atlantic Coastal Watersheds in Maryland, was collected at sufficient resolution to provide a nominal point spacing of 0.70 meters for collected points.

This task is for a high resolution data set of lidar covering approximately 1,845 square miles. The lidar data was acquired and processed under the requirements identified in this task order. Lidar data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. The final products include classified LAS, one (1) meter pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format, and 8-bit intensity images. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Additional deliverables include hydrologic breakline data, control data, tile index, lidar processing and survey reports in PDF format, FGDC metadata files for each data deliverable in .xml format, and LAS swath data. Ground conditions: Water at normal levels; no unusual inundation; no snow; leaf off. Coastal tiles 18SVH065720 and 8SVH095690 contain no lidar points as they exist completely in water. A DEM IMG was generated for these two tiles as the digitized hydro breakline assumed the data extent in the area. As such only 2568 LAS and Intensity files will be delivered along with 2570 DEM IMG's.Last Updated: 2015Feature Service Link:?https://lidar.geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Talbot/MD_talbot_shadedRelief_RGB/ImageServer",2018-01-25T16:06:57.000Z,2018-02-06T15:50:39.566Z,http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/c592fa35e3d34d2092e922b30137f5f0,https://lidar.geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Talbot/MD_talbot_shadedRelief_RGB/ImageServer,"-76.3521,38.5747,-75.8842,38.9476"

The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. The final products include classified LAS, one (1) meter pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format, and 8-bit intensity images. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Additional deliverables include hydrologic breakline data, control data, tile index, lidar processing and survey reports in PDF format, FGDC metadata files for each data deliverable in .xml format, and LAS swath data. Ground conditions: Water at normal levels; no unusual inundation; no snow; leaf off. Coastal tiles 18SVH065720 and 8SVH095690 contain no lidar points as they exist completely in water. A DEM IMG was generated for these two tiles as the digitized hydro breakline assumed the data extent in the area. As such only 2568 LAS and Intensity files will be delivered along with 2570 DEM IMG's.Last Updated: 2015Feature Service Link:?https://lidar.geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/BaltimoreCity/MD_baltimorecity_hillshade_m/ImageServer",2018-01-12T13:47:05.000Z,2018-02-06T15:56:21.065Z,http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/fd9692761b0a4438a58a80344257e043,https://lidar.geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/BaltimoreCity/MD_baltimorecity_hillshade_m/ImageServer,"-76.7147,39.1941,-76.5248,39.3754"

Lot #5 contains the full project area Dataset Description: The SANDY_Restoration_VA_MD_DC_QL2 project called for the Planning, Acquisition, processing and derivative products of LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base LiDAR Specification, Version 1. The data was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of UTM Zone 18 North, NAD83, meters and vertical datum of NAVD1988 (GEOID12A), meters. LiDAR data was delivered in RAW flight line swath format, processed to create Classified LAS 1.2 Files formatted to 2283 individual 1500m x 1500m tiles, and corresponding Intensity Images and Bare Earth DEMs tiled to the same 1500m x 1500m schema, and Breaklines in ESRI Shapefile format. The data was then converted to a horizontal projection/datum of NAD83 Maryland State Plane Coordinate System, Meters. LiDAR was delivered in Classified LAS 1.2 Files formatted to 328 individual 800 meter x 800 meter tiles, and corresponding Intensity Images and Bare Earth DEMs tiled to the same 800 meter x 800 meter schema, and Breaklines in ESRI Shapefile format. Ground Conditions: LiDAR was collected in Winter 2014, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. In order to post process the LiDAR data to meet task order specifications, Quantum Spatial established a total of 59 QA control points and 95 Land Cover control points that were used to calibrate the LiDAR to known ground locations established throughout the SANDY_Restoration_VA_MD_DC_QL2 project area.Last Updated: 2014Feature Service Link:?https://lidar.geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/WashingtonDC/MD_washingtonDC_hillshade_m/ImageServer",2018-01-25T18:15:44.000Z,2018-02-06T15:56:26.281Z,http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/39c2abad662c43029c194f2b64a814a8,https://lidar.geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/WashingtonDC/MD_washingtonDC_hillshade_m/ImageServer,"-77.1224,38.7855,-76.9007,38.9965"

This task is for a high resolution data set of lidar covering approximately 1,845 square miles. The lidar data was acquired and processed under the requirements identified in this task order. Lidar data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. The final products include classified LAS, one (1) meter pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format, and 8-bit intensity images. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Additional deliverables include hydrologic breakline data, control data, tile index, lidar processing and survey reports in PDF format, FGDC metadata files for each data deliverable in .xml format, and LAS swath data. Ground conditions: Water at normal levels; no unusual inundation; no snow; leaf off. Coastal tiles 18SVH065720 and 8SVH095690 contain no lidar points as they exist completely in water. A DEM IMG was generated for these two tiles as the digitized hydro breakline assumed the data extent in the area. As such only 2568 LAS and Intensity files will be delivered along with 2570 DEM IMG's.Last Updated: 2015Feature Service Link:?https://lidar.geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Kent/MD_kent_aspect_m/ImageServer",2018-01-24T16:24:36.000Z,2018-02-06T15:56:31.356Z,http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/8862c46e82784275b07be0c20b1304aa,https://lidar.geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Kent/MD_kent_aspect_m/ImageServer,"-76.2827,39.0074,-75.7526,39.3837"

The nominal pulse spacing for this project was no greater than 0.7 meters. This project was collected with a Riegl LMS-Q680i Full Waveform LiDAR Sensor which collects an intensity value, GPS Week Time, Flightline and echo number attributes for each discrete pulse. Dewberry used proprietary procedures to classify the LAS into an initial ground surface. Dewberry used proprietary procedures to classify the LAS and then performed manual classifications according to project specifications: 1-Unclassified, 2-Ground, 7-Noise, 9-Water, and 10-Ignored Ground due to breakline proximity. Dewberry produced 3D breaklines and combined these with the final LiDAR data to produce seamless DTMs, DSMs and hydro flattened DEMs, for 833 tiles (1500 meters x 1500 meters) that cover the project area.Last Updated: 2012Feature Service Link:?https://lidar.geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Wicomico/MD_wicomico_shadedRelief_RGB/ImageServer",2018-01-25T19:12:45.000Z,2018-02-06T15:50:54.732Z,http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/ced30300fb524f2ba93ad1f7544211cc,https://lidar.geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Wicomico/MD_wicomico_shadedRelief_RGB/ImageServer,"-75.9464,38.2184,-75.2903,38.5726"

This task is for a high resolution data set of lidar covering approximately 1,845 square miles. The lidar data was acquired and processed under the requirements identified in this task order. Lidar data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. The final products include classified LAS, one (1) meter pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format, and 8-bit intensity images. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Additional deliverables include hydrologic breakline data, control data, tile index, lidar processing and survey reports in PDF format, FGDC metadata files for each data deliverable in .xml format, and LAS swath data. Ground conditions: Water at normal levels; no unusual inundation; no snow; leaf off. Coastal tiles 18SVH065720 and 8SVH095690 contain no lidar points as they exist completely in water. A DEM IMG was generated for these two tiles as the digitized hydro breakline assumed the data extent in the area.

This task is for a high resolution data set of lidar covering approximately 1,845 square miles. The lidar data was acquired and processed under the requirements identified in this task order. Lidar data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. The final products include classified LAS, one (1) meter pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format, and 8-bit intensity images. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Additional deliverables include hydrologic breakline data, control data, tile index, lidar processing and survey reports in PDF format, FGDC metadata files for each data deliverable in .xml format, and LAS swath data. Ground conditions: Water at normal levels; no unusual inundation; no snow; leaf off. Coastal tiles 18SVH065720 and 8SVH095690 contain no lidar points as they exist completely in water. A DEM IMG was generated for these two tiles as the digitized hydro breakline assumed the data extent in the area. As such only 2568 LAS and Intensity files will be delivered along with 2570 DEM IMG's.Last Updated: 2015Feature Service Link:?https://lidar.geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Kent/MD_kent_hillshade_m/ImageServer",2018-01-24T16:54:45.000Z,2018-02-06T15:55:40.217Z,http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/b86ce978c9df4d549f2c6835a25f9825,https://lidar.geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Kent/MD_kent_hillshade_m/ImageServer,"-76.2827,39.0074,-75.7526,39.3837"

Fugro EarthData, Inc. acquired 151 flight lines in eight lifts on February 6, 7, 9, 13, 15, and 16, 2011; in tidal areas, data was collected within 2 hours (before or after) of mean low tide. The data was divided into 1500 by 1500 meter cells that serve as the tiling scheme. LiDAR data collection was performed with a Piper Navajo twin engine aircraft, utilizing a Leica ALS60 MPiA sensor, collecting multiple return x, y, and z as well as intensity data. LiDAR data is remotely sensed high-resolution elevation data collected by an airborne collection platform. This data of the Pocomoke and Atlantic Coastal Watersheds in Maryland, was collected at sufficient resolution to provide a nominal point spacing of 0.70 meters for collected points.

This task is for a high resolution data set of lidar covering approximately 1,845 square miles. The lidar data was acquired and processed under the requirements identified in this task order. Lidar data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. The final products include classified LAS, one (1) meter pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format, and 8-bit intensity images. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Additional deliverables include hydrologic breakline data, control data, tile index, lidar processing and survey reports in PDF format, FGDC metadata files for each data deliverable in .xml format, and LAS swath data. Ground conditions: Water at normal levels; no unusual inundation; no snow; leaf off. Coastal tiles 18SVH065720 and 8SVH095690 contain no lidar points as they exist completely in water. A DEM IMG was generated for these two tiles as the digitized hydro breakline assumed the data extent in the area. As such only 2568 LAS and Intensity files will be delivered along with 2570 DEM IMG's.Last Updated: 2015Feature Service Link:?https://lidar.geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Carroll/MD_carroll_aspect_m/ImageServer",2018-01-12T16:03:45.000Z,2018-02-06T15:52:38.149Z,http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/f2e7e67473454e12a3a6a10a7fd1adc1,https://lidar.geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Carroll/MD_carroll_aspect_m/ImageServer,"-77.3151,39.3404,-76.776,39.7282"

Find more information at?http://imap.maryland.gov.In the Chesapeake Bay relative sea level rise is impacting coastal lands at twice the global average rate.? Identifying long-term planning options to increase resiliency against coastal storm surge, flooding, and erosion is an important step in protecting Maryland's coastal zone.? Much of our natural buffering capacity against these coastal hazards, come from our coastal wetlands. In order to better understand the impacts sea level rise may have on the State's coastal marsh system, the Sea-Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) was run for all 16 coastal counties and Baltimore City.SLAMM uses elevation, accumulation of sediments, wetland accretion and erosion rates, and sea level rise to predicatively model long-term wetland and shoreline change. In Maryland, SLAMM was run using the best available science, including sea level rise rate identified at 3.4 feet by year 2100. The resulting changes to coastal marshes and shorelines can be visualized in their current state, 2050 and 2100 year scenarios. These results will be used to help frame new land conservation targeting in Maryland's coastal zone.

The data was formatted according to the Baltimore County tile naming convention.Last Updated: 2015Feature Service Link:?https://lidar.geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Baltimore/MD_baltimore_hillshade_m/ImageServer",2018-01-12T13:12:05.000Z,2018-02-06T15:56:33.368Z,http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/a92d7b082c67475997c864cc42d06492,https://lidar.geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Baltimore/MD_baltimore_hillshade_m/ImageServer,"-76.915,39.1934,-76.3172,39.7225"

Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base LIDAR Specification, Version 1. The data was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of State Plane Zone Maryland (1900), NAD83, feet and vertical datum of NAVD1988 (GEOID12A), feet. LiDAR data was delivered in RAW flight line swath format, processed to create Classified LAS 1.2 Files formatted to 3842 individual 1500m x 1500m tiles, and corresponding Intensity Images and Bare Earth DEMs tiled to the same 1500m x 1500m schema, and Breaklines in ESRI shapefile format. Ground Conditions: LiDAR was collected in Winter 2013 / Spring 2014, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. In order to post process the LiDAR data to meet task order specifications, Quantum Spatial established a total of 78 QA control points and 99 Land Cover control points that were used to calibrate the LIDAR to known ground locations established throughout the SANDY_Restoration_DE_MD_QL2 project area.Last Updated: 2013Feature Service Link:?https://lidar.geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Caroline/MD_caroline_dem_ft/ImageServer",2018-01-12T15:37:38.000Z,2018-02-06T15:49:37.188Z,http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/4db6accdc4b441f081ca1c55eba7a27c,https://lidar.geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Caroline/MD_caroline_dem_ft/ImageServer,"-76.0205,38.623,-75.6682,39.1535"
