The
Michigan Carpool Parking Lot Program (sometimes referred to as Park and Ride)
began as a pilot program in 1974 with 11 carpool parking lots. Today there are
over 240 carpool parking lots located across the state providing nearly 9,000
parking spaces. In addition to lots owned and maintained by MDOT, the Meijer
Corporation has partnered with MDOT to provide carpool parking at several of
their stores. Please see the?MDOT Metadata Form?for additional information.

Update
Cycle:?Carpool
lots are added and updated as needed when new lots are constructed or removed.

Coverage: This inventory shows all
MDOT owned and operated carpool lots in Michigan along with several Meijer
parking lots that provide carpool parking in partnership with MDOT.
