The use of LiDAR significantly reduces the cost for developing this information.The DSMs are intended to correspond to the orthometric heights of the surface of the county including above ground features such as buildings, vegetation cover, utility structures, vehicles ... etc. DSM data are used by county agencies and others to study drainage issues such as flooding and erosion; contour generation; slope and aspect; and hill shade images. Elevation data and models are used in several different ways including:Visualization representations of the elevation data. Examples include:-	A hillshaded or shaded relief image-	An image representing slope-	An image representing aspectAnalysis of the elevation data and analytical products which can be generated. Examples include:-	Viewshed calculations for visibility and line-of-sight analysis-	Areas of highest Solar energy potential-	Uses in disaster management-	Industrial planning-	Calculation of cartographic contours-	Calculation of profiles along straight lines or line segmentsThese data are derived from other data sources, no accuracy measurements or tests were conducted.

MARS (ver. 8.0.4, build 8185) software was used to create the GeoTIFF images.The DSMs were developed using LiDAR data. LiDAR is an acronym for LIght Detection And Ranging. Light detection and ranging is the science of using a laser to measure distances to specific points. A specially equipped airplane with positioning tools and LiDAR technology was used to measure the distance to the surface of the earth. The classified points were developed using data collected in April to May 2007. The LiDAR points, specialized software, and technology provide the ability to create a high precision three-dimensional digital elevation and/or terrain models (DEM/DTM) as well as digital surface models (DSM). The use of LiDAR significantly reduces the cost for developing this information.The DSMs are intended to correspond to the orthometric heights of the surface of the county including above ground features such as buildings, vegetation cover, utility structures, vehicles ... etc. DSM data are used by county agencies and others to study drainage issues such as flooding and erosion; contour generation; slope and aspect; and hill shade images. Elevation data and models are used in several different ways including:Visualization representations of the elevation data. Examples include:-	A hillshaded or shaded relief image-	An image representing slope-	An image representing aspectAnalysis of the elevation data and analytical products which can be generated. Examples include:-	Viewshed calculations for visibility and line-of-sight analysis-	Areas of highest Solar energy potential-	Uses in disaster management-	Industrial planning-	Calculation of cartographic contours-	Calculation of profiles along straight lines or line segmentsThese data are derived from other data sources, no accuracy measurements or tests were conducted.

Due to the lack of sufficient camera calibration information, errors will increase towards the margin of each underlying photo, although this effect has been minimized by cropping individual photos to make this mosaic. Since these photos were scanned from paper prints, local distortions (from the media stretching and/or shrinking) may be present as well as pen marks and fading. Caution should be used in interpreting features in this photography with reference to current conditions. In particular, many roads and road intersections have been realigned in the more than 60 years since this photography was taken. This historic aerial photography was captured in digital form as the result of a cooperative project between the Illinois State Geological Survey and the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Mapping Division of the Lake County Department of Information Technology.

The manual does not recommend that these data be used for final design, excavation and grading plans, earthwork computations for bid estimates or contract measurement and payment.Contour data is used by county agencies to study drainage issues such as flooding and erosion. Customers interested in the actual LiDAR data may download it at no cost from the USGS Center for LiDAR Information Coordination and Knowledge.These files are tiled by PLSS section and grouped by township and format for easier download.

The DSM is a 3-foot pixel resolution raster in GeoTIFF format, created using all points (excluding NOISE) from our 2007 LiDAR data without incorporating the breaklines. The SRPM was created using the ArcGIS 'Area Solar Radiation' geoprocessing tool. Due to the number of variables and parameters, the default values of the geoprocessing tool were used.The solar radiation analysis tools in the ArcGIS Spatial Analyst extension enables one to map and analyze the effects of the sun over a geographic area for specific time periods. It accounts for atmospheric effects, site latitude and elevation, steepness (slope) and compass direction (aspect), daily and seasonal shifts of the sun angle, and effects of shadows cast by surrounding topography. The resultant outputs can be easily integrated with other GIS data and can help model physical and biological processes as they are affected by the sun.These data are derived from other data sources, no accuracy measurements or tests were conducted. Primary use and intent for these data are for visualizations and topographic analysis.
