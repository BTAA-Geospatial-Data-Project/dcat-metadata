The EMS stations dataset consists of any location where emergency medical service (EMS) personnel are stationed or based out of, or where equipment that such personnel use in carrying out their jobs is stored for ready use. Ambulance services are included even if they only provide transportation services, but not if they are located at, and operated by, a hospital. If an independent ambulance service or EMS provider happens to be collocated with a hospital, it will be included in this dataset. The dataset includes both private and governmental entities. TGS has made a concerted effort to include all emergency medical service locations in the United States and its territories. This dataset is comprised completely of license free data. The HSIP Freedom Fire Station dataset and the HSIP Freedom EMS dataset were merged into one working file. TGS processed as one file and then separated for delivery purposes. Please see the process description for the breakdown of how the records were merged. Records with -DOD appended to the end of the [NAME] value are located on a military base, as defined by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) military installations and military range boundaries. At the request of NGA, text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results. At the request of NGA, all diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics.

Ineligible for Coverage under NWPs: Projects affecting high quality streams and undesignated streams draining directly to high quality streams, as represented in the map, must undergo individual 401 review process.

http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/1a3fed94104e4dc7a0bfce84f7e6718e_4,Ohio River Source Water Protection Areas  (open data),"**Change URL to https when loading layer to web map.The Ohio Source Water Protection Program is intended to protect Ohio's streams, rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and ground waters used for public drinking water from future contamination. To protect drinking water supplies, a protection area is delineated based on the area that supplies water to the well or surface water intake. A Drinking Water Source Water Protection Area for a public water system using ground water is the surface and subsurface area surrounding a public water supply well(s) which will provide water from an aquifer to the well(s) within five years as delineated or endorsed by the agency under Ohio's Wellhead Protection and Source Water Assessment and Protection Programs. The Inner Management Zone is the surface and subsurface area surrounding a public water supply well(s) that will provide water to the well(s) within one year as delineated or endorsed by the agency under the wellhead protection program and the source water assessment and protection program. Several types of source water protection areas have been defined for surface water supplied water systems. The definiton and the method of delineation are based on the type of water body from which the system withdrawls water. The waterbody types are 1) interior lakes, rivers or streams, 2) the Ohio River or 3) Lake Erie. All of these areas are delineated or endorsed by Ohio EPA under Ohio's Source Water Assessment and Protection Program. For systems with intakes on interior lakes, rivers and streams, three types of areas are defined: 1) the Drinking Water Source Protection Area (DWSPA)- the drainage area upstream of the point where a public water system withdraws water from a surface source; 2) the Corridor Managment Zone (CMZ) - the surface and subsurface area where the potential for drinking water contamination warrants delineation, inventory, and management because of its proximity to a public water system intake; and 3) the Emergency Management Zone - the surface and subsurface area in the immediate vicinity of a public water system intake. For systems with intakes on Lake Erie, a Critical Area Zone (CAZ) is delineated. The size of the CAZ is based upon the sensitivity of the intake to contamination which is determined by its depth and distance from shore. The shape and extent of this area may be modified to take into account site specific conditions. Contaminants within this zone can quickly impact water quality at the intake. A Potential Influence Zone (PIZ) may also be delineated. The PIZ is the area along the lake shore and any contributing tributaries up to the point of known contaminant sources and the length of shoreline where pollutants may become a threat to the intake. Public water systems with intakes on the Ohio River have three zones defined. Zone 1, or the Zone of Critical Concern, extends one quarter mile below a water intake to 25 miles upstream in the Ohio River. Zone 2, the Zone of High Concern extends one quarter mile below a surface water intake, upstream, to one quarter mile below the next Ohio River intake. Major tributaries are incorporated within a 25 mile distance upstream from the intake. Zone 3 is the Source Water Area, or the entire portion of the Ohio River Basin upstream from the surface water intake.",2016-07-07T12:34:57.000Z,2017-10-19T14:16:18.000Z,http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/1a3fed94104e4dc7a0bfce84f7e6718e_4,http://epagistest2.oit.ohio.gov/arcgis/rest/services/WM/DDAGW_SWP/MapServer/4,"-85.0,38.0,-80.0,42.2",http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/1a3fed94104e4dc7a0bfce84f7e6718e_4

This dataset includes those locations primarily engaged in forest or grasslands fire fighting, including fire lookout towers if the towers are in current use for fire protection purposes. This dataset includes both private and governmental entities. Fire fighting training academies are also included. TGS has made a concerted effort to include all fire stations in the United States and its territories. This dataset is comprised completely of license free data. The HSIP Freedom Fire Station dataset and the HSIP Freedom EMS dataset were merged into one working file. TGS processed as one file and then separated for delivery purposes. Please see the process description for the breakdown of how the records were merged.

http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/c40427b8d2a342b58e819f87d521abfb_0,Jewish Synagogues,"The Jewish Synagogues dataset is derived from the TGS 2009 Q4 'PlacesofWorship' data layer and contains all Jewish Synagogues in the United States. The remaining portion of this abstract, as well as much of the remaining metadata, references the entire Places of Worship database from which this subset was derived: The Places of Worship dataset is composed of any type of building or portion of a building that is used, constructed, designed, or adapted to be used as a place for religious and spiritual activities. These facilities include, but are not limited to, the following types: chapels, churches, mosques, shrines, synagogues, and temples. The license free Large Protestant Churches, Mosques, Jewish Synagogues, and Roman Catholic Churches in Large Cities datasets were merged together to create the initial data for the Places of Worship dataset. Additional entities have been added from TGS research. This dataset contains Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Islamic, Judaic, and Sikh places of worship. Unitarian places of worship have been included when a congregation from one of these religions meets at a church owned by a Unitarian congregation. Some Protestant denominations are not currently represented in this dataset. The Places of Worship dataset is not intended to include homes of religious leaders (unless they also serve as a place of organized worship), religious schools (unless they also serve as a place of organized worship for people other than those enrolled in the school), Jewish Mikvahs or Hillel facilities, and buildings that serve a purely administrative purpose. If a building's primary purpose is something other than worship (e.g., a community center, a public school), but a religious group uses the building for worship on a regular basis, it was included in this dataset if it otherwise met the criteria for inclusion. Convents and monasteries are included in this dataset, regardless of whether or not the facilities are open to the public, because religious services are regularly held at these locations. TGS was not tasked with ensuring the completeness of this layer. No entities are included in this dataset for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. On 08/07/2007, TGS ceased making phone calls to verify information about religious locations. Therefore, most entities in this dataset were verified using alternative reference sources such as topographic maps, parcel maps, various sources of imagery, and internet research. The [CONTHOW] (contact how) value for these entities has been set to ALT REF. The website http://www.gettochurch.org was used for verification during processing. As of August 2009, this website is no longer active. Records with -DOD appended to the end of the [NAME] value are located on a military base, as defined by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) military installations and military range boundaries. # and * characters were automatically removed from standard HSIP fields that TGS populated. Double spaces were replaced by single spaces in these same fields. At the request of NGA, text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results. At the request of NGA, all diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics. The currentness of this dataset is indicated by the [CONTDATE] field.

The SWAP program addresses more than 4,500 public water systems in Ohio. It does not address private residential water systems.Several types of source water protection areas have been defined for surface water supplied water systems. The definiton and the method of delineation are based on the type of water body from which the system withdrawls water. The waterbody types are 1) interior lakes, rivers or streams, 2) the Ohio River or 3) Lake Erie. All of these areas are delineated or endorsed by Ohio EPA under Ohio's Source Water Assessment and Protection Program. For systems with intakes on interior lakes, rivers and streams, three types of areas are defined: 1) the Drinking Water Source Protection Area (DWSPA)- the drainage area upstream of the point where a public water system withdraws water from a surface source; 2) the Corridor Managment Zone (CMZ) - the surface and subsurface area where the potential for drinking water contamination warrants delineation, inventory, and management because of its proximity to a public water system intake; and 3) the Emergency Management Zone - the surface and subsurface area in the immediate vicinity of a public water system intake. For systems with intakes on Lake Erie, a Critical Area Zone (CAZ) is delineated. The size of the CAZ is based upon the sensitivity of the intake to contamination which is determined by its depth and distance from shore. The shape and extent of this area may be modified to take into account site specific conditions. Contaminants within this zone can quickly impact water quality at the intake. A Potential Influence Zone (PIZ) may also be delineated. The PIZ is the area along the lake shore and any contributing tributaries up to the point of known contaminant sources and the length of shoreline where pollutants may become a threat to the intake. Public water systems with intakes on the Ohio River have three zones defined. Zone 1, or the Zone of Critical Concern, extends one quarter mile below a water intake to 25 miles upstream in the Ohio River. Zone 2, the Zone of High Concern extends one quarter mile below a surface water intake, upstream, to one quarter mile below the next Ohio River intake. Major tributaries are incorporated within a 25 mile distance upstream from the intake. Zone 3 is the Source Water Area, or the entire portion of the Ohio River Basin upstream from the surface water intake.For more information on the SWAP Program, visit?epa.ohio.gov/ddagw/swap.aspx, send an email to?whp@epa.ohio.gov?or call (614) 644-2752 and ask to speak with one of the Drinking Water Source Protection staff.?Data updated daily at midnight.?",2016-05-17T20:02:41.000Z,2017-10-19T14:11:59.000Z,http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/1b1cefb8cf88414d9b2c78815859f82b_2,http://epagistest2.oit.ohio.gov/arcgis/rest/services/WM/DDAGW_SWP/MapServer/2,"-85.0,38.0,-80.0,42.2",http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/1b1cefb8cf88414d9b2c78815859f82b_2

Each highway-rail or pathway crossing is assigned a unique alphanumeric seven digit identifier by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) as a part of the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008. This unique identifier is stored in a national database that can be used to quickly retrieve information about the physical and operating characteristics of both public and private crossings. In addition, this information can be used by Emergency Personnel to quickly and accurately locate calls for service. This unique identifier is commonly referred to as a Railroad Crossing ID or FRA Number. Each Railroad Crossing must have this number posted on a metal plate at each crossing. Many crossings have a sign that includes the name of the railroad and an emergency contact telephone number in addition to the Railroad Crossing ID.This information can be retrieved remotely from the Federal Railroad Administration, Office of Safety Analysis' website at: http://safetydata.fra.dot.gov/OfficeofSafety/PublicSite/Crossing/Crossing.aspx",2017-07-05T16:59:33.000Z,2017-08-11T19:58:03.000Z,http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/108ed84f78d64e72982996e9bfc28b32_3,http://maps2.columbus.gov/arcgis/rest/services/Schemas/PublicSafety/MapServer/3,"-83.622348,39.618368,-82.213504,40.436194",http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/108ed84f78d64e72982996e9bfc28b32_3

To protect drinking water supplies, a protection area is delineated based on the area that supplies water to the well or surface water intake. A Drinking Water Source Water Protection Area for a public water system using ground water is the surface and subsurface area surrounding a public water supply well(s) which will provide water from an aquifer to the well(s) within five years as delineated or endorsed by the agency under Ohio's Wellhead Protection and Source Water Assessment and Protection Programs. The Inner Management Zone is the surface and subsurface area surrounding a public water supply well(s) that will provide water to the well(s) within one year as delineated or endorsed by the agency under the wellhead protection program and the source water assessment and protection program. Several types of source water protection areas have been defined for surface water supplied water systems. The definiton and the method of delineation are based on the type of water body from which the system withdrawls water. The waterbody types are 1) interior lakes, rivers or streams, 2) the Ohio River or 3) Lake Erie. All of these areas are delineated or endorsed by Ohio EPA under Ohio's Source Water Assessment and Protection Program. For systems with intakes on interior lakes, rivers and streams, three types of areas are defined: 1) the Drinking Water Source Protection Area (DWSPA)- the drainage area upstream of the point where a public water system withdraws water from a surface source; 2) the Corridor Managment Zone (CMZ) - the surface and subsurface area where the potential for drinking water contamination warrants delineation, inventory, and management because of its proximity to a public water system intake; and 3) the Emergency Management Zone - the surface and subsurface area in the immediate vicinity of a public water system intake. For systems with intakes on Lake Erie, a Critical Area Zone (CAZ) is delineated. The size of the CAZ is based upon the sensitivity of the intake to contamination which is determined by its depth and distance from shore. The shape and extent of this area may be modified to take into account site specific conditions. Contaminants within this zone can quickly impact water quality at the intake. A Potential Influence Zone (PIZ) may also be delineated. The PIZ is the area along the lake shore and any contributing tributaries up to the point of known contaminant sources and the length of shoreline where pollutants may become a threat to the intake. Public water systems with intakes on the Ohio River have three zones defined. Zone 1, or the Zone of Critical Concern, extends one quarter mile below a water intake to 25 miles upstream in the Ohio River. Zone 2, the Zone of High Concern extends one quarter mile below a surface water intake, upstream, to one quarter mile below the next Ohio River intake. Major tributaries are incorporated within a 25 mile distance upstream from the intake. Zone 3 is the Source Water Area, or the entire portion of the Ohio River Basin upstream from the surface water intake.",2017-01-20T16:04:58.000Z,2017-10-19T14:31:11.000Z,http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/4f2fc5165c1944eaaaaeeda789cd02b3_1,http://epagistest2.oit.ohio.gov/arcgis/rest/services/WM/DDAGW_SWP/MapServer/1,"-85.0,38.0,-80.0,42.2",http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/4f2fc5165c1944eaaaaeeda789cd02b3_1

http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/ec34e1f8ef7948e88b330ba8addeb571_0,Veterans Health Administration Medical Facilities,"The Veterans Health Administration Medical Facilities dataset includes Veteran Affairs hospitals, Veteran Affairs Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Programs (RRTP), Veteran Affairs Nursing Home Care Units (NHCU), Veteran Affairs Outpatient Clinics (VAOC), Vet Centers, and Veteran Affairs Medical Centers (VAMC). It should not include planned and suspended (non-operational) sites and mobile clinics. These definitions were set by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Policy Board in December 1998 and are the basis for defining the category and the additional service types for each VHA service site. These definitions cover sites generally owned by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) with the exception of leased and contracted community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs). 1. VA HOSPITAL: an institution (health care site) that is owned, staffed and operated by VA and whose primary function is to provide inpatient services. NOTE: Each geographically unique inpatient division of an integrated facility is counted as a separate hospital. 2. VA RESIDENTIAL REHABILITATION TREATMENT PROGRAM (RRTP): provides comprehensive health and social services in a VA facility for eligible veterans who are ambulatory and do not require the level of care provided in nursing homes. 3. VA NURSING HOME CARE UNITS (NHCU): provides care to individuals who are not in need of hospital care, but who require nursing care and related medical or psychosocial services in an institutional setting. VA NHCUs are facilities designed to care for patients who require a comprehensive care management system coordinated by an interdisciplinary team. Services provided include nursing, medical, rehabilitative, recreational, dietetic, psychosocial, pharmaceutical, radiological, laboratory, dental and spiritual. 4. VA OUTPATIENT CLINICS: a. Community-Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC): a VA-operated, VA-funded, or VA-reimbursed health care facility or site geographically distinct or separate from a parent medical facility. This term encompasses all types of VA outpatient clinics, except hospital-based, independent and mobile clinics. Satellite, community-based, and outreach clinics have been redefined as CBOCs. Technically, CBOCs fall into four Categories, which are:  (i) VA-owned. A CBOC that is owned and staffed by VA.  (ii) Leased. A CBOC where the space is leased (contracted), but is staffed by VA. NOTE: This includes donated space staffed by VA.  (iii) Contracted. A CBOC where the space and the staff are not VA. This is typically a Healthcare Management Organization (HMO)-type provided where multiple sites can be associated with a single station identifier.  (iv) Not Operational. A CBOC which has been approved by Congress, but has not yet begun operating. b. Hospital-Based Outpatient Clinic: outpatient clinic functions located at a hospital. c. Independent Outpatient Clinic: a full-time, self-contained, freestanding, ambulatory care clinic that has no management, program, or fiscal relationship to a VA medical facility. Primary and specialty health care services are provided in an outpatient setting. 5. VET CENTER: Provides professional readjustment counseling, community education, outreach to special populations, brokering of services with community agencies, and access to links between the veteran and VA. 6. VA MEDICAL CENTER (VAMC): a medical center is a unique VA site of care providing two or more types of services that reside at a single physical site location. The services provided are the primary service as tracked in the VHA Site Tracking (VAST) (i.e., VA Hospital, Nursing Home, Domiciliary, independent outpatient clinic (IOC), hospital-based outpatient clinic (HBOC), and CBOC). The definition of VA medical center does not include the Vet Centers as an identifying service. This dataset is based upon GFI data received from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA).

http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/75b9011797c44afcb513d2c68d3e1b32_0,Mosques,"The Mosques dataset is derived from the TGS 2009 Q4 'PlacesofWorship' data layer and contains all mosques, Islamic centers, and Muslim centers in the United States. The remaining portion of this abstract, as well as much of the remaining metadata, references the entire Places of Worship database from which this subset was derived: The Places of Worship dataset is composed of any type of building or portion of a building that is used, constructed, designed, or adapted to be used as a place for religious and spiritual activities. These facilities include, but are not limited to, the following types: chapels, churches, mosques, shrines, synagogues, and temples. The license free Large Protestant Churches, Mosques, Jewish Synagogues, and Roman Catholic Churches in Large Cities datasets were merged together to create the initial data for the Places of Worship dataset. Additional entities have been added from TGS research. This dataset contains Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Islamic, Judaic, and Sikh places of worship. Unitarian places of worship have been included when a congregation from one of these religions meets at a church owned by a Unitarian congregation. Some Protestant denominations are not currently represented in this dataset. The Places of Worship dataset is not intended to include homes of religious leaders (unless they also serve as a place of organized worship), religious schools (unless they also serve as a place of organized worship for people other than those enrolled in the school), Jewish Mikvahs or Hillel facilities, and buildings that serve a purely administrative purpose. If a building's primary purpose is something other than worship (e.g., a community center, a public school), but a religious group uses the building for worship on a regular basis, it was included in this dataset if it otherwise met the criteria for inclusion. Convents and monasteries are included in this dataset, regardless of whether or not the facilities are open to the public, because religious services are regularly held at these locations. TGS was not tasked with ensuring the completeness of this layer. No entities are included in this dataset for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. On 08/07/2007, TGS ceased making phone calls to verify information about religious locations. Therefore, most entities in this dataset were verified using alternative reference sources such as topographic maps, parcel maps, various sources of imagery, and internet research. The [CONTHOW] (contact how) value for these entities has been set to ALT REF. The website http://www.gettochurch.org was used for verification during processing. As of August 2009, this website is no longer active. Records with -DOD appended to the end of the [NAME] value are located on a military base, as defined by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) military installations and military range boundaries. # and * characters were automatically removed from standard HSIP fields that TGS populated. Double spaces were replaced by single spaces in these same fields. At the request of NGA, text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results. At the request of NGA, all diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics. The currentness of this dataset is indicated by the [CONTDATE] field.

Some sites with hazardous waste are also included. The types of sites may include licensed landfills, landfills that existed prior to state regulatory programs, exempt waste sites, unauthorized dumps, open dumps, and disposal lagoons. Some sites in the database may have been partially or fully remediated and may no longer contain significant amounts of waste.?The data are incomplete and are still in development.  New locations will be added and existing locations may be corrected.  This file does not include all sites regulated by Ohio EPA under other regulatory programs (e.g. there are many sites regulated under programs such as hazardous waste sites, surface water, brownfields, etc. that are not included in this dataset).?Data were developed from Ohio EPA archival files. The accuracy of the locations depends on the available information. Where possible, points were located on the actual waste unit, or within the tax parcel boundary where the waste was said to be located. Some points were located using coordinates or descriptive text in field notes, inspection reports, etc.  In some cases, the best available information is the nearest intersection or an address. 
When possible the data were compared against local tax maps to improve the accuracy of the locations. Additional sources of information included but were not limited to newspaper archives, solid waste district plans, pollution inventories, historical societies, and local governments.?The information used in this dataset come from files that date back to the late 1960s and may not represent the current site conditions.

http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/5c1449de4d2b43658afc0937111de7da_1,Ohio House Districts,"The district maps represents the results of the 2012-2022 apportionment plan for the State of Ohio. The shapefiles were obtained from the Ohio Secretary of State's Office website. Detailed information regarding the development of these shapefiles can be found at: http://www.sos.state.oh.us/SOS/reshape/GADistricts/adoptedMap.aspxPart A. General Overview? 1.?? To assist users in their review of the legislative district plan, the plan geography is being provided in different formats. These include a geographic data file known as a shape file and a tabular data file known as an assignment file. The geographic file includes the boundaries for each district. The tabular data file includes one record for the lowest level of geography used to create the plan and the district to which it is assigned.? 2.?? Users with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software may note a handful of instances in which the appearance of the geography assigned to each district may not match the legal boundaries. Notes follow on these instances below.? 3.?? As a general caveat, whatever the geographic representation might appear to be when the legislative plan is viewed via any software, the controlling document as to the status of any geography is the legal definitions as submitted by the Joint Secretaries to the Ohio Apportionment Board. Those definitions can be found in this document.? 4.?? Any geographic area of the state not specifically named in this legal definition for House and Senate Districts that is wholly contained within the boundaries of a district but not contiguous to any district boundary, is assigned to that district. Any geographic area of the state not specifically named in this legal definition that is contiguous to any district boundary is assigned to that district with which it has the longest continuous boundary. If two or more boundaries are of equal length, the area is assigned to the district with less population. All districts are contiguous including those that are contiguous only by bodies of water.? 5.?? The legal definition will be posted at the following website designated by the Ohio Apportionment Board: http://www.reshapeohio.org.?? [link not valid as of 2/13/2015] Part B. Geographic Database? The underlying geographic database used to create plans for legislative districts was developed by the Urban Center at Cleveland State University (CSU) in conjunction with the Voinovich Center at Ohio University (OU) as part of the project to develop the 2010 Ohio Common and Unified Redistricting Database (OCURD). CSU was selected by bipartisan action by the co-chairs of the Ohio Legislative Task Force on Redistricting, Reapportionment and Demographic Research. The lowest level of geography in this database is not the census block but the split census block.? 1.?? The overall purpose of the project was to accommodate for the fact that many census blocks contain portions of multiple higher levels of geography, such as a precinct or a municipality. In geographic terms, these are known as ?split? units because they did not nest into the higher levels of geography. The project also enabled the creation of geographic layers for wards (which were not part of the census geographic products) and precincts that more closely reflect the boundaries used in the 2008 and 2010 elections.? 2.?? To create a geographic system that allowed for topological integrity, the OCURD project used the boundaries of the higher levels of geography as overlays and assigned the underlying census block, or portions thereof, to each of the higher levels. When the higher level geography crossed the census block, a new geographic unit was created known as a split block. It is this ?block split? layer of geography that was the lowest level of geography from which the legislative districts were created.? 3.?? Another goal of the OCURD project was to estimate the population in each portion of the split blocks. The project researched several means by which this could be accomplished and chose a method based upon the length of the streets in each such block. Because the population was estimated for each portion, the number of persons was not rounded to a whole person and thus some fractional numbers will be found.? 4.?? Another issue arose as the OCURD database was being used by the Joint Secretaries of the Ohio Apportionment Board to create legislative plans. This issue relates to the fact that many of the higher levels of geography, notably municipalities, wards, and precincts, contain multiple pieces of territory that are separated by distances short and long. In geographic terms, these are known as ?non-contiguous areas? (NCA) because there is some other land or water between the pieces. There are two types of NCAs: those that are not contiguous because they are islands surrounded by water and those that are not contiguous because they are legally or technically a portion of a geographic unit but surrounded by other land-based geographic units. Examples of the first type are the islands off the coast of Lake Erie. Examples of the second type abound in the state.? 5.?? In most cases, the multi-part units are combined for geographic representation in GIS software. In geographic terms, these are known as ?shapes? and are assigned to a district as one unit, even though there may be separate estimates of population for the blocks that comprise the higher level unit. Because they are combined as an entire shape they can only be assigned to one district by the GIS software used for the redistricting phase of the apportionment process. The software used by the Board to undertake this process was Maptitude for Redistricting (MTR) by Caliper Corporation.? 6.?? Requirements of the Ohio Constitution relate to both creating districts from contiguous territory and the maintenance of political subdivision boundaries. Therefore, making use of a multi-part area as the boundary of a district could present a situation in which a political subdivision would be split and a district would be created using non-contiguous territory.? 7.?? Whatever the geographic representation of the GIS software, the controlling document as to the status of any geography is the legal definition as adopted by the Apportionment Board. 8.?? Because some areas in the higher geographic levels are multi-part units the software flagged some districts as being non-contiguous. Notes on these situations follow.? ?Part C. Notes on Specific Districts:? The following areas include districts that were designated by the Maptitude software as having some non-contiguous areas:? 1.?? District 38?Stark County. Block 391517147013085 is split into two pieces including portions of precincts 151ANY  151AEB. The portion in 151ANY contains no population and is a part of district 49. See the item 4 in Part A and the legal definition.? 2.?? District 46?Lucas County. Several islands are located off the Lake Erie coast but are portions of Jerusalem Township. See the item 4 in Part A and the legal definition.? 3.?? District 48?Stark County. Block 391517123002009 is split into three pieces including portions of precincts 151ACD, 151AME, and 151ANG. Each of these portions contains no population. The triangular portion at the lower south east of the block is a part of district 49. See the item 4 in Part A and the legal definition.? 4.?? District 55?Lorain County. Several islands are located off the Lake Erie coast but are portions of Avon Lake City. See the item 4 in Part A and the legal definition.? 5.?? District 83?Hardin and Logan Counties. There is one unit in the ?Block Split? layer, 390650007003086091AAR, that is unassigned in the map. It contains no population and is surrounded by district 83. See the item 4 in Part A and the legal description.? 6.?? District 88?Sandusky County. One island is located in Sandusky Bay but is a portion of Riley Township. See the item 4 in Part A and the legal definition.7.?? District 89?Ottawa County.

The service area is the geographic area within which a 911 call placed using a landline is answered at the associated PSAP. This dataset only includes primary PSAPs. Secondary PSAPs, backup PSAPs, and wireless PSAPs have been excluded from this dataset. Primary PSAPs receive calls directly, whereas secondary PSAPs receive calls that have been transferred by a primary PSAP. Backup PSAPs provide service in cases where another PSAP is inoperable. Most military bases have their own emergency telephone systems. To connect to such a system from within a military base, it may be necessary to dial a number other than 9 1 1. Due to the sensitive nature of military installations, TGS did not actively research these systems. If civilian authorities in surrounding areas volunteered information about these systems, or if adding a military PSAP was necessary to fill a hole in civilian provided data, TGS included it in this dataset. Otherwise, military installations are depicted as being covered by one or more adjoining civilian emergency telephone systems. In some cases, areas are covered by more than one PSAP boundary. In these cases, any of the applicable PSAPs may take a 911 call. Where a specific call is routed may depend on how busy the applicable PSAPs are (i.e., load balancing), operational status (i.e., redundancy), or time of day / day of week. If an area does not have 911 service, TGS included that area in the dataset along with the address and phone number of their dispatch center. These are areas where someone must dial a 7 or 10 digit number to get emergency services. These records can be identified by a Y in the [NON911EMNO] field. This indicates that dialing 911 inside one of these areas does not connect one with emergency services. This dataset was constructed by gathering information about PSAPs from state level officials. In some cases, this was geospatial information; in other cases, it was tabular. This information was supplemented with a list of PSAPs from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Each PSAP was researched to verify its tabular information. In cases where the source data was not geospatial, each PSAP was researched to determine its service area in terms of existing boundaries (e.g., city and county boundaries). In some cases, existing boundaries had to be modified to reflect coverage areas (e.g., entire county north of Country Road 30).

http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/92f6d701e66a4d8c8b35c63484068840_0,Protestant Churches,"The Protestant_Churches dataset is derived from the TGS 2009 Q4 'PlacesofWorship' data layer and contains all Protestant churches in the United States. The remaining portion of this abstract, as well as much of the remaining metadata, references the entire Places of Worship database from which this subset was derived: The Places of Worship dataset is composed of any type of building or portion of a building that is used, constructed, designed, or adapted to be used as a place for religious and spiritual activities. These facilities include, but are not limited to, the following types: chapels, churches, mosques, shrines, synagogues, and temples. The license free Large Protestant Churches, Mosques, Jewish Synagogues, and Roman Catholic Churches in Large Cities datasets were merged together to create the initial data for the Places of Worship dataset. Additional entities have been added from TGS research. This dataset contains Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Islamic, Judaic, and Sikh places of worship. Unitarian places of worship have been included when a congregation from one of these religions meets at a church owned by a Unitarian congregation. Some Protestant denominations are not currently represented in this dataset. The Places of Worship dataset is not intended to include homes of religious leaders (unless they also serve as a place of organized worship), religious schools (unless they also serve as a place of organized worship for people other than those enrolled in the school), Jewish Mikvahs or Hillel facilities, and buildings that serve a purely administrative purpose. If a building's primary purpose is something other than worship (e.g., a community center, a public school), but a religious group uses the building for worship on a regular basis, it was included in this dataset if it otherwise met the criteria for inclusion. Convents and monasteries are included in this dataset, regardless of whether or not the facilities are open to the public, because religious services are regularly held at these locations. TGS was not tasked with ensuring the completeness of this layer. No entities are included in this dataset for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. On 08/07/2007, TGS ceased making phone calls to verify information about religious locations. Therefore, most entities in this dataset were verified using alternative reference sources such as topographic maps, parcel maps, various sources of imagery, and internet research. The [CONTHOW] (contact how) value for these entities has been set to ALT REF. The website http://www.gettochurch.org was used for verification during processing. As of August 2009, this website is no longer active. Records with -DOD appended to the end of the [NAME] value are located on a military base, as defined by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) military installations and military range boundaries. # and * characters were automatically removed from standard HSIP fields that TGS populated.

(Source: Urgent Care Association of America) The Urgent Care dataset consists of any location that is capable of providing emergency medical care and must provide emergency medical treatment beyond what can normally be provided by an EMS unit, must be able to perform surgery, or must be able to provide recuperative care beyond what is normally provided by a doctor's office. In times of emergency, the facility must be able to accept patients from the general population or patients from a significant subset of the general population (e.g., children). Florida and Arizona license Urgent Care facilities within their state. However, the criteria for licensing and the criteria for inclusion in this dataset do not appear to be the same. For these two states, this dataset contains entities that fit TGS' criteria for an Urgent Care facility but may not be licensed as Urgent Care by the state. During processing, TGS found that this is a rapidly changing industry. Although TGS intended for all Urgent Care facilities to be included in this dataset, the newest facilities may not be included. Entities that are excluded from this dataset are administrative offices, physician offices, workman compensation facilities, free standing emergency rooms, and hospitals. Urgent Care facilities that are operated by and co-located with a hospital are also excluded because the locations are included in the hospital dataset. ID# 10194253 is a mobile urgent care center that provides urgent care to private residences. This entity is plotted at its administrative building.

An Emergency Operations Center may be a temporary facility or may be located in a more central or permanently established facility, perhaps at a higher level of organization within a jurisdiction. Emergency Operations Centers may be organized by major functional disciplines (e.g., fire, law enforcement, and medical services), by jurisdiction (e.g., Federal, State, regional, county, city, tribal), or some combination thereof. (Excerpted from the National Incident Management System) The GFI source for this layer contains State and Federal Emergency Operations Centers in addition to local Emergency Operations Centers. This dataset contains these features as well. In cases where an Emergency Operations Center has a mobile unit, TechniGraphics captured the location of the mobile unit as a separate record. This record represents where the mobile unit is stored. If this location could not be verified, a point was placed in the approximate center of the Emergency Operations Centers service area. Effort was made by TechniGraphics to verify whether or not each Emergency Operations Center has a generator on-site and whether or not the Emergency Operations Center is located in a basement. This information is indicated by the values in the [GENERATOR] and [BASEMENT] fields respectively. In cases where more than one record existed for a geographical area (e.g., county, city), TechniGraphics verified whether or not one of the records represented an alternate location. This was indicated by appending -ALTERNATE to the value in the [NAME] field. Some Emergency Operations Centers are located at private residences. The [TYPE] field was manually evaluated during the delivery process to compare the records in which the [NAME] field contained -ALTERNATE. In cases where these values contradicted information that was verified by TechniGraphics (e.g. [NAME] contained -ALTERNATE and [TYPE] = PRIMARY), the value in the [TYPE] field was changed to match the type indicated by the [NAME] of the verified record. TechniGraphics did not change values in this field if the type was not verified.

http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/f2f7deb0efd44007b88355510aa49dfa_0,Oil and Gas Fields of Ohio,"These maps and database are an update of the Ohio Division of Geological Survey (ODGS) oil and gas fields Digital Chart and Map Series (DCMS 13 through 21), which was completed in 1996. Previous Ohio oil and gas fields maps were also published in 1948, 1953, 1960, 1964, and 1974. The updated maps and database have been created using the GIS-based ESRI/ARCMAP software. All documented oil and gas pools/fields have been digitized as polygons and each polygon is linked to a unique pool/field identification (ID) number and name. Like the previous DCMS oil and gas fields maps, the updated oil and gas pools/fields have been grouped into 8 major plays defined by specific stratigraphic intervals. These are the 1) Pennsylvanian undifferentiated sandstones and coals, 2) Mississippian undifferentiated sandstones (excluding the Berea and Cussewago Sandstone) and Maxville Limestone, 3) Mississippian Berea and Cussewago sandstones), 4) Upper Devonian Ohio Shale and siltstones, 5) Silurian/Devonian Big Lime interval (Onondaga Limestone, Oriskany Sandstone, Bass Islands Dolomite, Salina Group, and Lockport Dolomite), 6) Silurian Cataract/ Medina sandstone (Clinton/Medina) and Dayton Formation (Packer Shell), 7) Middle Ordovician fractured shale, Trenton Limestone and Black River Group and Wells Creek Formation, and 8) Cambrian-Ordovician Knox Dolomite (Beekmantown dolomite, Rose Run sandstone, Copper Ridge dolomite, B-zone, and Krysik sandstone). All oil and gas pool/field ID's are defined and grouped by play and not geographic boundary, since most of the producing oil and gas reservoirs in Ohio occur within stratigraphic traps. This is a departure from the method used in the 1974 map in which oil and gas fields were assigned geographically, and not by producing horizon. Thus on the 1974 map, one field could contain multiple, stacked, partially overlapping, producing horizons from the Cambrian to the Pennsylvanian. Since the 1974 map was produced, over 58,000 additional wells have been drilled and completed in multiple, stacked producing horizons, mostly in unique stratigraphic traps. This has made it too cumbersome to assign all producing horizons to the same pool/field ID within any given geographic area. Assignment of pool/field ID's by play or stratigraphic interval provides a better geologic method of displaying and defining these pools/fields that are dominantly stratigraphic traps. With this method of outlining polygons for producing horizons, a pool is defined as a single polygon that produces from horizons within one play. When more than one polygon is assigned the same ID within the same play, these polygons are defined as a field. Pool/field production types are displayed as gas (red), oil (green), or storage (orange). In most cases, the assignment of production type was determined from the 1974 Ohio oil and gas field map. For updates to the 1974 map, the production type (excluding the Knox Dolomite play) was determined by the dominance of oil or gas symbol as displayed on the township well spot maps. In many cases a subjective decision was made, since many of the wells are displayed as combination oil and gas. With the Knox Dolomite play, the production type was based on gas-to-oil ratio (GOR) using data from the ODGS production database POGO (Production of Oil and Gas in Ohio). Oil production is shown for pools/fields with a GOR less than 5,000, and gas for fields with a GOR greater than 5,000. Calculations are based on cumulative production since 1984. This method of using GOR was not possible for the other, older historical plays because of insufficient production data. Whenever possible, existing outlines from the 1996 digital oil and gas fields maps were used. Exceptions to this are in areas where the 1996-pool/field boundaries were modified or new pool/field boundaries were created from additional drilling. Pool/field boundaries were digitized based upon documented wells from the ODGS township well spot maps, and in some areas from the Ohio Fuel Gas (OFG) well spot maps. The OFG maps were used primarily for the Pennsylvanian and Mississippian plays because many of these older wells are not located on the ODGS township well spot maps. In some areas, digitized pools/fields from the 1996 version were deleted if the oil and gas township and/or the OFG maps or well cards could not verify them. A minimum of 3 producing wells within a 1-mile distance was required to draw a pool/field outline. Storage field outlines are approximate and are based primarily on the 1974 map. In drawing new polygons for pool/field boundaries, a buffer of 1/2 mile was made around each producing well, and boundaries were drawn using these buffers. In assigning pool/field ID's, the historical numbers and names from the 1974 map were maintained whenever possible. Pools/fields may be consolidated into a larger consolidated field only if they occur within the same play. When two or more pools/fields are consolidated, they were assigned a new field ID. The name of the consolidated field was taken from the oldest pool/field within the consolidated field. There may be exceptions to this if the name is firmly entrenched in literature (i.e., Canton Consolidated, East Canton Consolidated, etc.). In a given geographic area of multiple producing horizons, the same ID was maintained for the dominant producing horizon. The less dominant producing horizons in other plays for this geographic area were assigned new pool/field ID's. Every pool/field with an assigned number has also been assigned a unique name. If it is a new pool/field ID that was not on the 1974 map, a new name was assigned using the nearest place name (i.e., town, village, city, etc.) or a named geographic feature (i.e., stream, river, ridge, etc.) from a topographic map.",2017-11-08T17:51:35.000Z,2017-11-08T18:00:31.131Z,http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/f2f7deb0efd44007b88355510aa49dfa_0,https://gis.ohiodnr.gov/arcgis/rest/services/DOG_Services/Oilgas_Fields/MapServer/0,"-84.8504,38.4135,-80.483,41.9687",http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/f2f7deb0efd44007b88355510aa49dfa_0

This program was established in 1967 to measure seasonal and annual water quality changes in the state's major aquifers. The network initially consisted of 12 large production wells, and was expanded to 60 wells in 1972. In 1986, the network was further expanded to around 90 wells. A large number of public water supply wells were added to the network in the late 1980s and early 1990s to provide better representation of the major aquifers in Ohio.The program currently includes over 200 wells (stations). Of the total stations, roughly 85 percent are public water systems and 15 percent are industrial or commercial enterprises or residential. Raw water is analyzed for a suite of inorganic parameters every six, 18, or 36 months depending on the total number of samples that have been collected and the stability of the geochemistry of major elements at the site. Samples are also analyzed for volatile organic compounds once every 18 or 36 months. Some ambient sites have historical semi-volatile organic compounds and pesticide data.",2017-06-07T18:06:30.000Z,2017-10-19T14:30:38.000Z,http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/11a37e1df07e426eab79f01bb5d119d0_2,http://epagistest2.oit.ohio.gov/arcgis/rest/services/WM/DDAGW_WI/MapServer/2,"-180.0,-90.0,180.0,90.0",http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/11a37e1df07e426eab79f01bb5d119d0_2

http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/a4d355e48c44422b96cbea8d71f43930_0,Catholic Churches,"The CatholicChurches dataset is derived from the TGS 2009 Q4 'PlacesofWorship' data layer and contains all Catholic churches in the United States. The remaining portion of this abstract, as well as much of the remaining metadata, references the entire Places of Worship database from which this subset was derived: The Places of Worship dataset is composed of any type of building or portion of a building that is used, constructed, designed, or adapted to be used as a place for religious and spiritual activities. These facilities include, but are not limited to, the following types: chapels, churches, mosques, shrines, synagogues, and temples. The license free Large Protestant Churches, Mosques, Jewish Synagogues, and Roman Catholic Churches in Large Cities datasets were merged together to create the initial data for the Places of Worship dataset. Additional entities have been added from TGS research. This dataset contains Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Islamic, Judaic, and Sikh places of worship. Unitarian places of worship have been included when a congregation from one of these religions meets at a church owned by a Unitarian congregation. Some Protestant denominations are not currently represented in this dataset. The Places of Worship dataset is not intended to include homes of religious leaders (unless they also serve as a place of organized worship), religious schools (unless they also serve as a place of organized worship for people other than those enrolled in the school), Jewish Mikvahs or Hillel facilities, and buildings that serve a purely administrative purpose. If a building's primary purpose is something other than worship (e.g., a community center, a public school), but a religious group uses the building for worship on a regular basis, it was included in this dataset if it otherwise met the criteria for inclusion. Convents and monasteries are included in this dataset, regardless of whether or not the facilities are open to the public, because religious services are regularly held at these locations. TGS was not tasked with ensuring the completeness of this layer. No entities are included in this dataset for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. On 08/07/2007, TGS ceased making phone calls to verify information about religious locations. Therefore, most entities in this dataset were verified using alternative reference sources such as topographic maps, parcel maps, various sources of imagery, and internet research. The [CONTHOW] (contact how) value for these entities has been set to ALT REF. The website http://www.gettochurch.org was used for verification during processing. As of August 2009, this website is no longer active. Records with -DOD appended to the end of the [NAME] value are located on a military base, as defined by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) military installations and military range boundaries. # and * characters were automatically removed from standard HSIP fields that TGS populated. Double spaces were replaced by single spaces in these same fields. At the request of NGA, text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results. At the request of NGA, all diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics. The currentness of this dataset is indicated by the [CONTDATE] field.

A hurricane evacuation route is a designated route used to direct traffic inland in case of a hurricane threat. This dataset is based on supplied data from Gulf Coast and Atlantic Seaboard states. Each state was contacted by TGS to determine an official source for hurricane evacuation routes. GIS data was gathered from states willing to share such data. In cases where states were unable or unwilling to share data in this format, TGS requested that the states provide a source for identifying hurricane evacuation routes. The states usually identified a website that made this data available to the public. Three (3) states (ME, NY, and NH) indicated that they do not maintain public maps showing hurricane evacuation routes and were unable or unwilling to share GIS files depicting such routes. Hurricane evacuation routes depicted on non-GIS maps were digitized using aerial ortho imagery while referencing supplied maps. Shape files that depicted hurricane evacuation routes were edge matched and merged with the digitized evacuation routes. All routes identified as primary hurricane evacuation routes were included in this dataset. If a state also designated secondary hurricane evacuation routes, they were included as well. Routes depicted in this dataset are dependent upon what each state identified as a hurricane evacuation route. Criteria used to identify these routes may vary from state to state.",2016-02-10T02:06:05.000Z,2017-11-14T21:07:31.777Z,http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/0eab4e109ce2412882db595aa4555759_0,https://services2.arcgis.com/1cdV1mIckpAyI7Wo/arcgis/rest/services/Hurricane_Evacuation_Routes/FeatureServer/0,"-99.50272,24.55039,-71.13373,41.89679",http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/0eab4e109ce2412882db595aa4555759_0

The Private Non-Retail Shipping layer contains motor carrier freight terminals for some of largest trucking companies in the U.S. (as measured by revenue reported by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics). Entities from the following companies are included: United Parcel Service (UPS), Yellow Freight System, Schneider, Roadway Express , FedEx , Con-Way Transportation , ABF Freight System, DHL, Corporate headquarters and other locations that do not actually handle freight are not included. No data could be obtained for Consolidated Freightways, Ryder Integrated Logistics, RPS and J.B. Hunt Transport Services. Facilities associated with these companies are not included in this dataset even though these companies have more annual revenue that some of the companies that are represented in this dataset. Many smaller, but still significant, companies have been excluded due to resource constraints. Examples include United Van Lines, Overnite Transportation, and American Freightways. Rail, air, sea, pipeline and inter-modal terminals are not included unless they are operated by one of the companies represented in this dataset. Facilities associated with the United States Postal Service (USPS) are not included. This dataset does not include retail shipping stores, drop boxes, and transportation operations that are not operated for hire. No entities located in American Samoa, The Northern Mariana Islands or the Virgin Islands are included in this dataset. The companies represented in this dataset are involved in the parcel delivery / courier service business or the freight service provider business. Parcel delivery / courier services deliver parcels, packages and other small shipments that typically weight less than 100 pounds according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. A freight service provider can include motor carriers, for-hire carriers and freight forwarders. According to the United Shippers Corporation, a motor carrier is defined as a company that provides truck transportation. A for-hire carrier is defined as a company that provides truck transportation of cargo belonging to others and is paid for doing so. A freight forwarder is defined as a company that arranges for truck transportation of cargo belonging to others, utilizing for-hire carriers to provide the actual truck transportation. The forwarder does assume the responsibility for the cargo from origin to destination and usually does take possession of the cargo at some point during the transportation. Forwarders typically assemble and consolidate less-than-truckload shipments into truckload shipments at origin and disassemble and deliver less-than-truckload shipments at destination. The intention of TGS is to include only those entities that meet the above definition. TGS was not able to contact all of the entities in this layer to verify that they met this definition, therefore some entities may be included in this layer that do not meet the definition. Text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results. All diacritics (e.g. the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics.

To protect drinking water supplies, a protection area is delineated based on the area that supplies water to the well or surface water intake. A Drinking Water Source Water Protection Area for a public water system using ground water is the surface and subsurface area surrounding a public water supply well(s) which will provide water from an aquifer to the well(s) within five years as delineated or endorsed by the agency under Ohio's Wellhead Protection and Source Water Assessment and Protection Programs. The Inner Management Zone is the surface and subsurface area surrounding a public water supply well(s) that will provide water to the well(s) within one year as delineated or endorsed by the agency under the wellhead protection program and the source water assessment and protection program. Several types of source water protection areas have been defined for surface water supplied water systems. The definiton and the method of delineation are based on the type of water body from which the system withdrawls water. The waterbody types are 1) interior lakes, rivers or streams, 2) the Ohio River or 3) Lake Erie. All of these areas are delineated or endorsed by Ohio EPA under Ohio's Source Water Assessment and Protection Program. For systems with intakes on interior lakes, rivers and streams, three types of areas are defined: 1) the Drinking Water Source Protection Area (DWSPA)- the drainage area upstream of the point where a public water system withdraws water from a surface source; 2) the Corridor Managment Zone (CMZ) - the surface and subsurface area where the potential for drinking water contamination warrants delineation, inventory, and management because of its proximity to a public water system intake; and 3) the Emergency Management Zone - the surface and subsurface area in the immediate vicinity of a public water system intake. For systems with intakes on Lake Erie, a Critical Area Zone (CAZ) is delineated. The size of the CAZ is based upon the sensitivity of the intake to contamination which is determined by its depth and distance from shore. The shape and extent of this area may be modified to take into account site specific conditions. Contaminants within this zone can quickly impact water quality at the intake. A Potential Influence Zone (PIZ) may also be delineated. The PIZ is the area along the lake shore and any contributing tributaries up to the point of known contaminant sources and the length of shoreline where pollutants may become a threat to the intake. Public water systems with intakes on the Ohio River have three zones defined. Zone 1, or the Zone of Critical Concern, extends one quarter mile below a water intake to 25 miles upstream in the Ohio River. Zone 2, the Zone of High Concern extends one quarter mile below a surface water intake, upstream, to one quarter mile below the next Ohio River intake. Major tributaries are incorporated within a 25 mile distance upstream from the intake. Zone 3 is the Source Water Area, or the entire portion of the Ohio River Basin upstream from the surface water intake.",2016-07-07T12:30:51.000Z,2017-10-19T14:14:25.000Z,http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/340969acd47a4e2ca70a24d1c8f32f0b_3,http://epagistest2.oit.ohio.gov/arcgis/rest/services/WM/DDAGW_SWP/MapServer/3,"-85.0,38.0,-80.0,42.2",http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/340969acd47a4e2ca70a24d1c8f32f0b_3

http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/2cf4c00c83bd45b5b130303af6736ca8_0,Watersheds,"The USGS National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) service from The National Map (TNM) is a comprehensive set of digital spatial data that encodes information about naturally occurring and constructed bodies of surface water (lakes, ponds, and reservoirs), paths through which water flows (canals, ditches, streams, and rivers), and related entities such as point features (springs, wells, stream gages, and dams). The information encoded about these features includes classification and other characteristics, delineation, geographic name, position and related measures, a reach code through which other information can be related to the NHD, and the direction of water flow. The network of reach codes delineating water and transported material flow allows users to trace movement in upstream and downstream directions. In addition to this geographic information, the dataset contains metadata that supports the exchange of future updates and improvements to the data. The NHD is available nationwide in two seamless datasets, one based on 1:24,000-scale maps and referred to as high resolution NHD, and the other based on 1:100,000-scale maps and referred to as medium resolution NHD. Additional selected areas in the United States are available based on larger scales, such as 1:5,000-scale or greater, and referred to as local resolution NHD. The NHD from The National Map supports many applications, such as making maps, geocoding observations, flow modeling, data maintenance, and stewardship. For additional information on the NHD, go to http://nhd.usgs.gov/index.html.The Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) is a companion dataset to the NHD. It defines the perimeter of drainage areas formed by the terrain and other landscape characteristics. The drainage areas are nested within each other so that a large drainage area, such as the Upper Mississippi River, will be composed of multiple smaller drainage areas, such as the Wisconsin River. Each of these smaller areas can further be subdivided into smaller and smaller drainage areas. The WBD uses six different levels in this hierarchy, with the smallest averaging about 30,000 acres. The WBD is made up of polygons nested into six levels of data respectively defined by Regions, Subregions, Basins, Subbasins, Watersheds, and Subwatersheds. For additional information on the WBD, go to http://nhd.usgs.gov/wbd.html.",2017-06-29T14:28:11.000Z,2017-06-29T14:31:12.023Z,http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/2cf4c00c83bd45b5b130303af6736ca8_0,http://epagistest2.oit.ohio.gov/arcgis/rest/services/WM/Watersheds/MapServer/0,"-86.3723,38.1906,-78.8477,42.9282",http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/2cf4c00c83bd45b5b130303af6736ca8_0

School district boundaries were created based upon voter registration records to support various initiatives across multiple state agencies. CSU, NODIS used the school district assignment on the current voter registration record to establish where the district boundaries are. The address locations of voters will be assigned to the Census Bureau's TIGER geographic database and both automated and manual procedures implemented to create the school district boundaries. In addition, the school district names were updated by comparing and reconciling the names provided on the 2001-2002 Census file with those provided in the voter registration database. In 2007, this dataset was updated for 34 counties. The school district boundaries were created from county auditor supplied parcel boundary source data. The parcel boundaries were dissolved on tax district ids to form school district polygons. The resulting polygons were then conflated to centerline, railroad, hydrography, and political boundary data to form a complete school district layer covering the entire county. The data set was last updated in 2014.",2015-02-06T15:25:43.000Z,2017-03-17T18:30:22.287Z,http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/92b9d4a3a6004add995ec75c950180ff_1,http://geo.oit.ohio.gov/arcgis/rest/services/SchoolDistricts/FeatureServer/1,"-84.9187,38.3802,-80.4797,41.9937",http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/92b9d4a3a6004add995ec75c950180ff_1

http://ogrip-geohio.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/ece7900854a443c28e1351a2eb3d7e7c_0,All Places of Worship,"Places of Worship in the United States. The Places of Worship dataset is composed of any type of building or portion of a building that is used, constructed, designed, or adapted to be used as a place for religious and spiritual activities. These facilities include, but are not limited to, the following types: chapels, churches, mosques, shrines, synagogues, and temples. The license free Large Protestant Churches, Mosques, Jewish Synagogues, and Roman Catholic Churches in Large Cities datasets were merged together to create the initial data for the Places of Worship dataset. Additional entities have been added from TGS research. This dataset contains Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Islamic, Judaic, and Sikh places of worship. Unitarian places of worship have been included when a congregation from one of these religions meets at a church owned by a Unitarian congregation. Some Protestant denominations are not currently represented in this dataset. The Places of Worship dataset is not intended to include homes of religious leaders (unless they also serve as a place of organized worship), religious schools (unless they also serve as a place of organized worship for people other than those enrolled in the school), Jewish Mikvahs or Hillel facilities, and buildings that serve a purely administrative purpose. If a building's primary purpose is something other than worship (e.g., a community center, a public school), but a religious group uses the building for worship on a regular basis, it was included in this dataset if it otherwise met the criteria for inclusion. Convents and monasteries are included in this dataset, regardless of whether or not the facilities are open to the public, because religious services are regularly held at these locations. TGS was not tasked with ensuring the completeness of this layer. No entities are included in this dataset for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. On 08/07/2007, TGS ceased making phone calls to verify information about religious locations. Therefore, most entities in this dataset were verified using alternative reference sources such as topographic maps, parcel maps, various sources of imagery, and internet research. The [CONTHOW] (contact how) value for these entities has been set to ALT REF. The website http://www.gettochurch.org was used for verification during processing. As of August 2009, this website is no longer active. Records with -DOD appended to the end of the [NAME] value are located on a military base, as defined by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) military installations and military range boundaries. # and * characters were automatically removed from standard HSIP fields that TGS populated. Double spaces were replaced by single spaces in these same fields. At the request of NGA, text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results. At the request of NGA, all diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics.

A local health department may be locally governed, part of a region or district, be an office or an administrative unit of the state health department, or a hybrid of these. Furthermore, each community has a unique public health system comprising individuals and public and private entities that are engaged in activities that affect the public's health. (Excerpted from the Operational Definition of a functional local health department, National Association of County and City Health Officials, November 2005) Please reference http://www.naccho.org/topics/infrastructure/accreditation/upload/OperationalDefinitionBrochure-2.pdf for more information. Facilities involved in direct patient care are intended to be excluded from this dataset; however, some of the entities represented in this dataset serve as both administrative and clinical locations. This dataset only includes the headquarters of Public Health Departments, not their satellite offices. Some health departments encompass multiple counties; therefore, not every county will be represented by an individual record. Also, some areas will appear to have over representation depending on the structure of the health departments in that particular region. Town health officers are included in Vermont and boards of health are included in Massachusetts. Both of these types of entities are elected or appointed to a term of office during which they make and enforce policies and regulations related to the protection of public health. Visiting nurses are represented in this dataset if they are contracted through the local government to fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the local health organization. Since many town health officers in Vermont work out of their personal homes, TechniGraphics represented these entities at the town hall. This is denoted in the [DIRECTIONS] field. Effort was made by TechniGraphics to verify whether or not each health department tracks statistics on communicable diseases. Records with -DOD appended to the end of the [NAME] value are located on a military base, as defined by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) military installations and military range boundaries. # and * characters were automatically removed from standard HSIP fields populated by TechniGraphics.

The shapefiles were obtained from the Ohio Secretary of State's Office website. Detailed information regarding the development of these shapefiles can be found at: http://www.sos.state.oh.us/SOS/reshape/GADistricts/adoptedMap.aspxTHE FOLLOWING IS AN EXERPT FROM THE? FINAL OHIO APPORTIONMENT PLAN? AS AMENDED, ADOPTED AND ENGROSSED ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2011 - http://www.sos.state.oh.us/sos/upload/reshape/GA/Apportionment-Engrossed.pdfPart A. General Overview? 1.?? To assist users in their review of the legislative district plan, the plan geography is being provided in different formats. These include a geographic data file known as a shape file and a tabular data file known as an assignment file. The geographic file includes the boundaries for each district. The tabular data file includes one record for the lowest level of geography used to create the plan and the district to which it is assigned.? 2.?? Users with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software may note a handful of instances in which the appearance of the geography assigned to each district may not match the legal boundaries. Notes follow on these instances below.? 3.?? As a general caveat, whatever the geographic representation might appear to be when the legislative plan is viewed via any software, the controlling document as to the status of any geography is the legal definitions as submitted by the Joint Secretaries to the Ohio Apportionment Board. Those definitions can be found in this document.? 4.?? Any geographic area of the state not specifically named in this legal definition for House and Senate Districts that is wholly contained within the boundaries of a district but not contiguous to any district boundary, is assigned to that district. Any geographic area of the state not specifically named in this legal definition that is contiguous to any district boundary is assigned to that district with which it has the longest continuous boundary. If two or more boundaries are of equal length, the area is assigned to the district with less population. All districts are contiguous including those that are contiguous only by bodies of water.? 5.?? The legal definition will be posted at the following website designated by the Ohio Apportionment Board: http://www.reshapeohio.org.?? [link not valid as of 2/13/2015] Part B. Geographic Database? The underlying geographic database used to create plans for legislative districts was developed by the Urban Center at Cleveland State University (CSU) in conjunction with the Voinovich Center at Ohio University (OU) as part of the project to develop the 2010 Ohio Common and Unified Redistricting Database (OCURD). CSU was selected by bipartisan action by the co-chairs of the Ohio Legislative Task Force on Redistricting, Reapportionment and Demographic Research. The lowest level of geography in this database is not the census block but the split census block.? 1.?? The overall purpose of the project was to accommodate for the fact that many census blocks contain portions of multiple higher levels of geography, such as a precinct or a municipality. In geographic terms, these are known as ?split? units because they did not nest into the higher levels of geography. The project also enabled the creation of geographic layers for wards (which were not part of the census geographic products) and precincts that more closely reflect the boundaries used in the 2008 and 2010 elections.? 2.?? To create a geographic system that allowed for topological integrity, the OCURD project used the boundaries of the higher levels of geography as overlays and assigned the underlying census block, or portions thereof, to each of the higher levels. When the higher level geography crossed the census block, a new geographic unit was created known as a split block. It is this ?block split? layer of geography that was the lowest level of geography from which the legislative districts were created.? 3.?? Another goal of the OCURD project was to estimate the population in each portion of the split blocks. The project researched several means by which this could be accomplished and chose a method based upon the length of the streets in each such block. Because the population was estimated for each portion, the number of persons was not rounded to a whole person and thus some fractional numbers will be found.? 4.?? Another issue arose as the OCURD database was being used by the Joint Secretaries of the Ohio Apportionment Board to create legislative plans. This issue relates to the fact that many of the higher levels of geography, notably municipalities, wards, and precincts, contain multiple pieces of territory that are separated by distances short and long. In geographic terms, these are known as ?non-contiguous areas? (NCA) because there is some other land or water between the pieces. There are two types of NCAs: those that are not contiguous because they are islands surrounded by water and those that are not contiguous because they are legally or technically a portion of a geographic unit but surrounded by other land-based geographic units. Examples of the first type are the islands off the coast of Lake Erie. Examples of the second type abound in the state.? 5.?? In most cases, the multi-part units are combined for geographic representation in GIS software. In geographic terms, these are known as ?shapes? and are assigned to a district as one unit, even though there may be separate estimates of population for the blocks that comprise the higher level unit. Because they are combined as an entire shape they can only be assigned to one district by the GIS software used for the redistricting phase of the apportionment process. The software used by the Board to undertake this process was Maptitude for Redistricting (MTR) by Caliper Corporation.? 6.?? Requirements of the Ohio Constitution relate to both creating districts from contiguous territory and the maintenance of political subdivision boundaries. Therefore, making use of a multi-part area as the boundary of a district could present a situation in which a political subdivision would be split and a district would be created using non-contiguous territory.? 7.?? Whatever the geographic representation of the GIS software, the controlling document as to the status of any geography is the legal definition as adopted by the Apportionment Board. 8.?? Because some areas in the higher geographic levels are multi-part units the software flagged some districts as being non-contiguous. Notes on these situations follow.? ?Part C. Notes on Specific Districts:? The following areas include districts that were designated by the Maptitude software as having some non-contiguous areas:? 1.?? District 38?Stark County. Block 391517147013085 is split into two pieces including portions of precincts 151ANY  151AEB. The portion in 151ANY contains no population and is a part of district 49. See the item 4 in Part A and the legal definition.? 2.?? District 46?Lucas County. Several islands are located off the Lake Erie coast but are portions of Jerusalem Township. See the item 4 in Part A and the legal definition.? 3.?? District 48?Stark County. Block 391517123002009 is split into three pieces including portions of precincts 151ACD, 151AME, and 151ANG. Each of these portions contains no population. The triangular portion at the lower south east of the block is a part of district 49. See the item 4 in Part A and the legal definition.? 4.?? District 55?Lorain County. Several islands are located off the Lake Erie coast but are portions of Avon Lake City. See the item 4 in Part A and the legal definition.? 5.??
