A TMDL is the amount of a pollutant a waterbody can receive and still meet water quality standards. Basically it is a pollution budget for a water body or watershed that establishes the pollutant reduction needed from each pollutant source to meet water quality goals.Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act requires all states to develop TMDLs for waters on the Impaired Waters List. A TMDL is the amount of a pollutant a water can receive and still meet water quality standards. The analysis can be expressed as a formula:TMDL = Wasteload Allocation (WLA) + Load Allocation (LA) + Margin of Safety (MOS).The WLA is the total allowable pollutant load from point sources (municipal and industrial wastewater facilities, CAFOs, and MS4s). The LA is the load assigned to nonpoint sources (agricultural runoff, non?regulated urban areas). The MOS is the margin of safety which accounts for any uncertainty in the analysis and modeling.To establish a TMDL, Wisconsin?s numeric water quality standards or applicable water quality targets based on narrative water quality standards are used. Water quality monitoring and measured flow in the watershed quantify current pollutant loads to the impaired water. To calculate the pollutant loads, computer models are used. Specific information for the model is needed such as: weather, topography, soil types, and land use. With these and other data inputs, the model simulates physical processes associated with the flow of water, sediment movement, nutrient cycling, crop growth, etc. Models can also be used to predict impacts of changes in land use, climate, and management practices on water quality. TMDL modeling determines the existing load and the target load to calculate the load reduction needed from each pollutant source.",2017-06-23T15:44:56.000Z,2017-07-05T15:29:54.000Z,http://data-wi-dnr.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/6404fecb33254292bb79cb8303aa30ef_7,https://dnrmaps.wi.gov/arcgis/rest/services/WT_TMDL/WT_RRTMDL_WTM_Ext/MapServer/7,"-89.6091,42.484,-88.1553,43.7883",http://data-wi-dnr.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/6404fecb33254292bb79cb8303aa30ef_7

 Wisconsin's
     Water Management Units data layer contains 24 delineated basins created
     initially for the Priority Watershed Program. Basins and watersheds are
     interconnected areas of land draining from surrounding ridge tops to a
     common point such as a lake or confluence with a neighboring land area.


?
These basins, delineated
by DNR, generally indicate areas that drain into a common river system or lake,
but may also be based on DNR basin management criteria.

Basically it is a pollution budget for a water body or watershed that establishes the pollutant reduction needed from each pollutant source to meet water quality goals.Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act requires all states to develop TMDLs for waters on the Impaired Waters List. A TMDL is the amount of a pollutant a water can receive and still meet water quality standards.

The LA is the load assigned to nonpoint sources (agricultural runoff, non?regulated urban areas). The MOS is the margin of safety which accounts for any uncertainty in the analysis and modeling.To establish a TMDL, Wisconsin?s numeric water quality standards or applicable water quality targets based on narrative water quality standards are used. Water quality monitoring and measured flow in the watershed quantify current pollutant loads to the impaired water. To calculate the pollutant loads, computer models are used. Specific information for the model is needed such as: weather, topography, soil types, and land use. With these and other data inputs, the model simulates physical processes associated with the flow of water, sediment movement, nutrient cycling, crop growth, etc. Models can also be used to predict impacts of changes in land use, climate, and management practices on water quality.

It is derived, in part, from the SSURGO soil surveys, a compound topographic layer derived from the statewide 10m DEM, Wisconsin 24K Hydro Layer, Wisconsin Wetlands Inventory and the Restoration Database. The extraction of soil polygons is based on two fields and is refined by the CTI values of 10 or greater*. The selecting fields are Percent Hydric and PWSL. All polygons that were greater or equal to 75% hydric were automatically selected for consideration. In addition, Soil Polygons that had a Percent Hydric from 1 - 74 were also selected, and all polygons that were not in these two sets that had a PWSL value between 1 - 80 and null were added also considered. All duplicate Polygons were then removed leaving behind unique soil units for consideration. Soil units with 75% or greater Percent Hydric were automatically added to the penultimate dataset, and rest were only considered based on the CTI values of 10 or greater inside their respective units. These cells were simplified based on their values and a minimum area threshold of .09 acres was chosen to begin the selection process. The selection process began with these base polygons and used a repetitive selection of 1.2m to select the nearest cells = 10. This process ran for thirty-two iterations (32) for deriving the relevant CTI structure. This output was then intersected with the selecting Soil Units to reattach the tabular attributes. The larger percentage soil units and the small units are then merged and from this merged layer the current Wetland Inventory, Hydro, and Restoration Database are erased from the layer. Urban areas, including roads and active railroad corridors are then extracted, labelled and reinserted to the layer. Finally, all units less than .1 acres are deleted from the set. Those polys that contained CTI values that could indicated pooling or high overland flow and were in Non hydric soils and adjacent to either a PRW or a Wetland were selected and labeled Contributing Area#. Finally, those polygons that are greater than .1 acres and smaller than .5 acres are labeled as Less than 0.5 Acres.*Where the CTI values are concerned it was found, independent of confirmation by efforts in Texas and Minnesota, that value threshold is somewhere between 9.7 and 9.9 depending on topography, soil composition, and exposed bedrock. Where the CTI is used in the process the value of 9.9 was reclassified into the value of 10. In addition, it was found that a value of 12 was needed to more accurately reflect current water conditions where Sand was the chief component of the Ecological Landscape.#This term is currently being revisited, while technically correct, interferes with a current legal definition.",2017-08-22T14:06:27.000Z,2017-11-20T20:18:43.778Z,http://data-wi-dnr.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/db7b10c5d3664449a377e9d53e6f1076,https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=04ee9425804d4bf2b5b3e304c42a4cc7,"-180.0,-90.0,180.0,90.0",http://data-wi-dnr.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/db7b10c5d3664449a377e9d53e6f1076

The NHFEU is an ecological classification system that divides landscapes into ecologically significant regions at multiple scales. Ecological types are classified and units are mapped based on the associations of biotic and environmental factors which include climate, physiography, water, soils, air, hydrology, and potential natural communities.?Purpose: In Wisconsin, Land Type Associations and other levels of the NHFEU have been delineated and are being used as large-scale ecological units for resource assessment and planning projects. Wisconsin delineated the finer landscape scale LTA layer of the NHFEU. The development of this layer of information supplies a spatially oriented, ecological classification tool that is available to a variety of landowners, land managers, and resource interest groups in Wisconsin and the Great Lake States.?Supplemental Information: Land Type Association (LTA) information depicts subregional and landscape ecological units developed according to the classification scheme of the NHFEU (Avers et al., 1994). The LTAs were developed, mapped and described in participation with a variety of agencies, organizations, and individuals.

The survey was conducted by private surveyors under contract to the General Land Office for the purpose of subdividing unsettled US lands for sale. Land was first surveyed into townships of 36 square miles, which where subsequently subdivided into 36 sections, each 1 square mile. Survey posts were set at the corner of each section (section corners) and at the midpoint between section corners (quarter section corners), resulting in a regular array of corners at half mile intervals along a 1 square mile grid. Additional survey posts were set when the survey line intersected navigable bodies of water at places called meander corners. Between 2 and 4 bearing trees were identified near each section, quarter section, and meander corner and recorded in the surveyors' notebooks, along with the presence of individual trees located along the survey lines between corners and the nature of the ecosystems through which the survey traversed.
 
We systematically went through microfilms and scanned ditigal images of the surveyors' notebooks and extracted vegetative information about the bearing trees, ecosystems, and disturbances recorded therein. This information was entered into a tabular database. Many trees were ambiguous noted only to genus level (e.g., birch, maple, pine). We used statistical methods to assign species to most of these trees (birch, oak, pine, maple, ash in northern Wisconsin, pine in southern Wisconsin). More information on this methodology can be found in Mladenoff, D.J., S.E. Dahir, E.V. Nordheim, L.A. Schulte, G.G. Guntenspergen. 2002. Narrowing historical uncertainty: Probabilistic classification of ambiguously identified tree species in historical forest survey data. Ecosystems 5, 539-553. Additionally maples and birches in southern Wisconsin were subjectively classified to species level based on location and associated species.

contact:?Mark Riedel?(608)275-3471.Impaired waters in Wisconsin are addressed through an analysis, known as a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL). A TMDL is the amount of a pollutant a waterbody can receive and still meet water quality standards. Basically it is a pollution budget for a water body or watershed that establishes the pollutant reduction needed from each pollutant source to meet water quality goals.Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act requires all states to develop TMDLs for waters on the Impaired Waters List. A TMDL is the amount of a pollutant a water can receive and still meet water quality standards. The analysis can be expressed as a formula:TMDL = Wasteload Allocation (WLA) + Load Allocation (LA) + Margin of Safety (MOS).The WLA is the total allowable pollutant load from point sources (municipal and industrial wastewater facilities, CAFOs, and MS4s). The LA is the load assigned to nonpoint sources (agricultural runoff, non?regulated urban areas). The MOS is the margin of safety which accounts for any uncertainty in the analysis and modeling.To establish a TMDL, Wisconsin?s numeric water quality standards or applicable water quality targets based on narrative water quality standards are used. Water quality monitoring and measured flow in the watershed quantify current pollutant loads to the impaired water. To calculate the pollutant loads, computer models are used. Specific information for the model is needed such as: weather, topography, soil types, and land use. With these and other data inputs, the model simulates physical processes associated with the flow of water, sediment movement, nutrient cycling, crop growth, etc. Models can also be used to predict impacts of changes in land use, climate, and management practices on water quality. TMDL modeling determines the existing load and the target load to calculate the load reduction needed from each pollutant source.",2017-06-23T16:11:22.000Z,2017-07-06T16:07:40.000Z,http://data-wi-dnr.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/aa74fd1acdac4e83b214a06f63aba408_13,https://dnrmaps.wi.gov/arcgis/rest/services/WT_TMDL/WT_RRTMDL_WTM_Ext/MapServer/13,"-89.6091,42.484,-88.1553,43.7883",http://data-wi-dnr.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/aa74fd1acdac4e83b214a06f63aba408_13
