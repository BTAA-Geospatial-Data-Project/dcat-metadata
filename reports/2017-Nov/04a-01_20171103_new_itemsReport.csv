In several instances, these MPO boundaries extend beyond Maryland?s borders into neighboring states as well as the District of Columbia. MPO Boundaries? data includes information on each boundary's name, geographic location, and the total size / extent of each area. MPO Boundaries data was intended to be used for planning purposes within governments at the National and State level. Maryland's MPO Boundaries data is a sub-set of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology's Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) National Transportation Atlas Database (NTAD).?A metropolitan planning organization (MPO) is a federally-mandated and federally-funded transportation policy-making organization that is made up of representatives from local governments and governmental transportation authorities. Federal law requires the formation of an MPO for any urbanized area (UZA) with a population greater than 50,000. Federal funding for transportation projects and programs are channeled through this planning process. Congress created MPOs to ensure that existing and future expenditures of federal funds for transportation projects and programs are based on a continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive (?3?C?) planning process. MPOs are charged with developing a 20-year long-range transportation plan (LRTP) and a short-term (usually 2-6 years) program called the transportation improvement program (TIP) for each of their respective regions. 

The seven MPOs of which Maryland jurisdictions and agencies are members are listed below. The Maryland member jurisdictions are listed under each MPO (note that some MPOs cover multi-State regions).

These objectives range from serving long-distance passenger and freight needs to serving neighborhood travel from residential developments to nearby shopping centers. The functional classification of roadways defines the role each element of the roadway network plays in serving these travel needs. ? Over the years, functional classification has come to assume additional significance beyond its purpose as a framework for identifying the particular role of a roadway in moving vehicles through a network of highways. Functional classification carries with it expectations about roadway design, including its speed, capacity and relationship to existing and future land use development. Federal legislation continues to use functional classification in determining eligibility for funding under the Federal-aid program.

Find more information at?http://imap.maryland.gov.Linear features which specifically show the types of control over vehicle access to public roadways in the State of Maryland.? Roadway Access Control is classified into three types, which are Full Control, Partial Control, and No Control.? Roadway Access Control data is primarily used for investment requirements modeling to calculate capacity and estimate type of design, in truck size and weight studies, and for national highway database purposes. The Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) currently reports this data only on the inventory direction (generally North or East). Access Control data is administrative for planning purposes and is not a complete representation of all roadway geometry.Roadway Access Control data is developed as part of the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) which maintains and reports transportation related information to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on an annual basis. HPMS is maintained by the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), under the Office of Planning and Preliminary Engineering (OPPE) Data Services Division (DSD). This data is used by various modules throughout MDOT, as well as many other State and local government agencies. This data is key to understanding the types of control over vehicle access to public roadways in the State of Maryland.Roadway Access Control data is updated and published on an annual (yearly) basis for the prior year.
