These arethe statistical counterparts of incorporated places, and are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the state in which they are located. The boundaries usually are defined in cooperation with local or tribal officials and generally updated prior to each decennial census. These boundaries, which usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity boundary, have no legal status, nor do these places have officials elected to serve traditional municipal functions. CDP boundaries may change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary. CDPs must be contained within a single state and may not extend into an incorporated place. There are no population size requirements for CDPs.","","dataset","2016-07-18T15:18:20","2015-02-25T21:37:54","2016-07-10T18:54:09","2015","2015","Michigan, United States###Demographics###Census","-88.4579###-82.2626###41.7008###47.2141","public","https://gis.michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/2e7d9b6b3f2c435baba8492eca5b5a01_4.zip###https://gisago.mcgi.state.mi.us/arcgis/rest/services/OpenData/michigan_geographic_framework/MapServer/4###https://gis.michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/2e7d9b6b3f2c435baba8492eca5b5a01_4","ESRI Shapefile","","","",

Another description could refer to it as a \"striped lane mile inventory\". The definition of a lane mile is \"one mile of roadway that is intended for driving\". The LMI supports the delivery of annual maintenance and capital funds to MDOT's regions. Attributes that are collected with this effort are number of lanes, lane function, maintenance responsibility, road type, speed limit, bike lanes, on street parking, and sidewalks. Please see theMDOT Metadata Formfor additional information.Update Cycle: The yearly release of the LMI represents changes to the existing roadway (number of drivable lanes) that are submitted by the regions from new projects every year. The entire system is updated on a 5-year cycle.;Data Quality: Data is collected to +/- 25ft accuracy using a laptop equipped with ArcGIS Desktop and a tethered USB puck GPS unit.;Coverage: This inventory is complete in its coverage of all State of Michigan trunkline roadways.;Symbology: The symbology for the LMI is categorized using the current \"LANE_YEAR\" field with different colors for each lane number and a size 2 line.;Contact: Kevin McKnight,mcknightk@michigan.gov","6319ec2d8bb445e990881c5fd9c4d198_0","dataset","2017-04-07T12:35:00","","","2015","2015","Michigan, United States","-90.2677###-82.135###41.6417###47.4964","public","https://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/###https://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/6319ec2d8bb445e990881c5fd9c4d198_0.zip###https://opengeometadata.github.io/big-ten/4b/ae/95/1286da48458ee35b66bf92249d/iso19139###https://gisago.mcgi.state.mi.us/arcgis/rest/services/MDOT/mdot_opendata/MapServer/0###https://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/6319ec2d8bb445e990881c5fd9c4d198_0","ESRI Shapefile","State of Michigan GIS Open Data/ CSS-AGO@michigan.gov","","",

These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979). Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands. These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery. By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of \"farmed wetlands\" as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition.

The data is used to populate the MiBridge System for bridge mounted signs inspection, for designers to determine existing bridge and bridge mounted sign information when upgrading overhead signs attached to bridges, and for contractors when performing installation of bridge mounted signs.Please see theMDOT Metadata Formfor additional information.Update Cycle: Bridge Connections inventory was last updated on April 3, 2015 as part of the initial inventory conducted by a signing pre-qualified consultant, OHM. Updates are anticipated, but a schedule and time line are still being developed.;Data Quality: The inventory effort utilized tablets with Trimble Terraflex software to collect the bridge connection locations, attributes, and photos.

The baseflow of a stream or river is the amount of groundwater discharged from an aquifer to the watercourse. This discharge occurs year-round, and fluctuates seasonally depending on the level of the water in the aquifer. Baseflow is supplemented by direct runoff during and immediately after precipitation or melt events, resulting in peaks on a hydrograph showing stream flow through time. The process of dividing these peaks into base flow and runoff is called hydrograph separation. Hydrograph separations were completed for all USGS stream- flow gaging stations in Michigan that had more than 10 years of daily records. Sites that were clearly affected by upstream impoundments (lakes, dams) were excluded. No attempt was made to detect or correct for trends in the data. This may lead to some errors in the comparison of streams with data from different time periods if there is an underlying temporal trend in the data, but inclusion of all records in the analysis was necessary to increase the data pool and provide better spatial coverage. Watersheds were delineated for each of the 208 stream-flow gaging stations, and various characteristics of each watershed, such as topographic relief, surficial geology, land cover, growing degree days, annual and winter-season precipitation, and others were tabulated. Regression modeling, described in the Technical Report, was used to estimate the baseflow for each steam segment of the 1:100,000-scale National Hydrography Dataset.","e8e263ecfc634c56ac89adefd4a21454_3","dataset","2017-04-07T12:35:27","","","2015","2015","Michigan, United States###Hydrology","-90.3951###-82.4174###41.2769###47.4692","public","https://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/###https://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/e8e263ecfc634c56ac89adefd4a21454_3.zip###https://opengeometadata.github.io/big-ten/dc/4e/84/eb10064229884379201c00944a/iso19139###https://gisago.mcgi.state.mi.us/arcgis/rest/services/OpenData/hydro/MapServer/3###https://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/e8e263ecfc634c56ac89adefd4a21454_3","ESRI Shapefile","State of Michigan GIS Open Data/ CSS-AGO@michigan.gov","","",
