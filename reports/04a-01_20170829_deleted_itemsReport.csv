Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.This dataset provides the Tier II catchments delineated for the most downstream Tier II segment. This file also provides the assimilative capacity (AC) status for each watershed. In cases where there is no remaining AC in a nested catchment but the larger encompassing segment has remaining AC, the smaller nested catchment is split out and assigned its own identification. These nested catchments are also then attributed to show the lack of AC remaining. The intended use of the catchment dataset is to assist State, Local, and Federal officials and stakeholders in determining the antidegradation status of current or planned activities which fall under the purview of the antidegradation policy and implementation procedure (COMAR 26.08.02.04-1).  Using GIS, the stakeholder can assess if any activity, proposed or operational, such as a discharge, is located on land which drains (has run off) directly into and can potentially adversely affect a Tier II stream segment.  This type of determination would be useful for permitting purposes, screening for sensitive or high quality resources, and various land use planning activities such as those undertaken by local officials during the Water Resources Element process, Water and Sewer Planning, or the Comprehensive Planning process.Last Updated: 2012Feature Service Layer Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Hydrology/MD_WaterQuality/FeatureServer/1",2016-02-10T18:05:59.000Z,2017-08-17T16:13:57.317Z,http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/c83e66c46c694ffb9b99bda1dc507ed0_1,http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Hydrology/MD_WaterQuality/FeatureServer/1,"-79.5073,38.0147,-75.3428,39.9149",http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/c83e66c46c694ffb9b99bda1dc507ed0_1

Find more information at http://imap.maryland.gov.The intent of this dataset is for it to be used to produce maps and provide a spatial reference for all Tier II segments located in Maryland. The Clean Water Act requires that States review their water quality standards every three years and revise the standards as necessary.  During this required Triennial Review the State reviewed the antidegradation policy, and identified additional stream segments that meet the minimum requirements. Current Tier II designations are made based on biological characteristics from Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) data, which is collected annually. MBSS data which identifies new Tier II segments in between Triennial Review cycles are maintained on the pending list, as they are awaiting formal promulgation. The publicly maintained list of all Tier II waters can be found for each county at the following website:  http://mde.maryland.gov/programs/Water/TMDL/Integrated303dReports/Pages/Antidegradation.aspx. This dataset is intended to be used in conjunction with the other official Tier II MDE datasets:  Tier II Stream Catchments, Tier II MBSS Stations, and Tier II Stream Endpoints.Last Updated: 2012Feature Service Layer Link:http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Hydrology/MD_WaterQuality/FeatureServer/0",2016-02-10T18:02:12.000Z,2017-08-17T16:17:10.935Z,http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/6bb54dfd580e4fe5805bc462052d4463_0,http://geodata.md.gov/imap/rest/services/Hydrology/MD_WaterQuality/FeatureServer/0,"-79.4376,38.0268,-75.3549,39.7291",http://data.imap.maryland.gov/datasets/6bb54dfd580e4fe5805bc462052d4463_0
