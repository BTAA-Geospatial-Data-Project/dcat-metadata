These data were developed from LIDAR data obtained between April 16, 2007 and May 07, 2007, and further supplemented by break lines collected from aerial photography taken at the same time. The contours and the aerial photography meet National Map Accuracy Standards for a 1 inch = 100 foot product. The contours have been created to be cartographically pleasing, as such some generalization has been introduced as expected. The contours have been tested against the original LIDAR points and conforms to the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) Specifications and Standards Committee, 1990, ASPRS Accuracy Standards for Large-Scale Maps, CLASS 1 map accuracy. The vertical datum is the North American Vertical Datum of 1988.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers?Engineering and Design Manual for Photogrammetric Production?recommends that data intended for this usage scale be used for any of the following purposes: route location, preliminary alignment and design, preliminary project planning, hydraulic sections, rough earthwork estimates, or high-gradient terrain / low unit cost earthwork excavation estimates. The manual does not recommend that these data be used for final design, excavation and grading plans, earthwork computations for bid estimates or contract measurement and payment.Contour data is used by county agencies to study drainage issues such as flooding and erosion. Customers interested in the actual LiDAR data may download it at no cost from the USGS Center for LiDAR Information Coordination and Knowledge.These files are tiled by PLSS section and grouped by township and format for easier download. Please note that this dataset is available in for GIS in Esri shapefile format as well as for CAD in AutoCAD DWG and MicroStation DGN.

 or fill material. This process is called an Advanced Identification or 
ADID. Under the ADID process identification of an area as generally 
unsuitable for fill does not prohibit applications for permits to fill 
in these areas. Therefore the ADID designation of unsuitability is 
advisory not regulatory.

        An ADID designation lets a potential applicant know in 
advance that a proposal to fill such a site is not likely to be 
consistent with the 404(b)(1) guidelines, and the USEPA will probably 
request permit denial.

        ADID wetland information is also useful in watershed 
planning, land use planning, public land acquisition programs, natural 
resource studies and other purposes.

        The wetland selection criteria and methodology are documented
 in the publication entitled Advanced Identification (ADID) Study, Lake
 County, Illinois. Final Report, November 1992 which is included in 
this download.

        Boundaries were delineated by the ADID project team on 
orthophotograph background with an intended usage scale of 1 = 400', a

These data were developed from LIDAR data obtained between April 16, 2007 and May 07, 2007, and further supplemented by break lines collected from aerial photography taken at the same time. The contours and the aerial photography meet National Map Accuracy Standards for a 1 inch = 100 foot product. The contours have been created to be cartographically pleasing, as such some generalization has been introduced as expected. The contours have been tested against the original LIDAR points and conforms to the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) Specifications and Standards Committee, 1990, ASPRS Accuracy Standards for Large-Scale Maps, CLASS 1 map accuracy. The vertical datum is the North American Vertical Datum of 1988.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers?Engineering and Design Manual for Photogrammetric Production?recommends that data intended for this usage scale be used for any of the following purposes: route location, preliminary alignment and design, preliminary project planning, hydraulic sections, rough earthwork estimates, or high-gradient terrain / low unit cost earthwork excavation estimates. The manual does not recommend that these data be used for final design, excavation and grading plans, earthwork computations for bid estimates or contract measurement and payment.Contour data is used by county agencies to study drainage issues such as flooding and erosion. Customers interested in the actual LiDAR data may download it at no cost from the USGS Center for LiDAR Information Coordination and Knowledge.These files are tiled by PLSS section and grouped by township and format for easier download.

Led by the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development (DMPED) in conjunction with the Office of Planning (OP) and the District Department of Transportation (DDOT), Great Streets has grown into a multi-year, multi-agency program that utilizes public actions and resources to leverage private investment in retail, office space, housing, and cultural facilities across the District. The Government of the District of Columbia through the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development (DMPED) administers the Great Streets Retail Small Business Reimbursement Grants, which are competitive grants of up to $50,000 for qualified small business owners who wish to improve their place of business. The purpose of the grant program is to support existing small businesses, attract new businesses, increase the District's tax base, create new job opportunities for District residents, and transform emerging commercial corridors into thriving and inviting neighborhood centers.
