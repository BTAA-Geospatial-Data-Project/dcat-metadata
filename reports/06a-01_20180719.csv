began as a pilot program in 1974 with 11 carpool parking lots. Today there are
over 240 carpool parking lots located across the state providing nearly 9,000
parking spaces. In addition to lots owned and maintained by MDOT, the Meijer
Corporation has partnered with MDOT to provide carpool parking at several of
their stores. Please see the?MDOT Metadata Form?for additional information.

Update
Cycle:?Carpool
lots are added and updated as needed when new lots are constructed or removed.

This layer is one of five that depicts trout and salmon fishing regulations for inland streams for the State of Michigan for April 1, 2016 - April 1, 2018 based on Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Fisheries Order 200.16A.Features from the 1:24,000 scale National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) were used to depict the 2016-2018 Michigan trout and salmon inland stream regulations. NHD features were altered to fit the extent of the regulations described in FO 200.16 and FO 210.16. Every inland stream reach in this package has a regulation type (or multiple regulation types) and a designation status. The regulation type is indicated in the Reg_Type field and the designation status is indicated in the Designated field (with 0 as non-designated and 1 as designated) Each regulation type is associated with specific rules for the length of the fishing and possession seasons, minimum size limits, and daily possession limits. See FO 200.16 and the Michigan Fishing Guide for more details about the individual regulation types.Regulation types are as follows:1 - Type 1 Trout Stream2 - Type 2 Trout Stream3 - Type 3 Trout Stream4 - Type 4 Trout StreamBTRA ? Brook Trout Restoration AreaRA - Research Area Trout StreamGR - Gear Restricted StreamDesignation status is either designated or non-designated. Designated trout streams are inland streams containing a significant population of trout or salmon, as identified by the State of Michigan. Designated trout streams are protected from certain activities, see the Michigan Fishing Guide or FO 210.16 for more details. All Type 1, Type 2, GR, and BTRA are designated trout streams. Most Type 3 and Type 4 streams are designated trout streams. Most inland salmon and trout stream regulations are depicted in the main trout and salmon stream regulations layer. Streams with multiple regulations will have additional features in the BTRA lines, BTRA polygon or the dual regulation layers.  All four layers must be displayed in the proper order using the established symbology to show the trout and salmon inland stream regulations for the state. The BTRA polygon layer should be displayed on the top of the other layers, with the dual regulations underneath the BTRA polygon, the main file underneath the dual regulations, and finally the BTRA lines on the bottom.

Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) does have many locations or
features which help or particularly benefit those public users, photography
enthusiasts, birdwatchers, or hunters who have special mobility needs and
benefit from special accessible conditions to reach our outdoor and wildlife
resources.? The DNR website has details
and a wide variety of accessible, ADA compliant rules, guidelines and features
and (see webpage http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-153-10366_41825---,00.html and subpage on hunting / wildlife
information at http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-153-10366_41825_51108---,00.html ).?
Users may require only walking assistance devices or may be those with
specific wheelchairs, personal assistive mobility devices (PAMDs), or other
motorized-type vehicles.? 

Please
check rules for specific rules, regulations, and restrictions as they relate to
what equipment might be used, before using such equipment, as not all equipment
legal on public places, residential or commercial buildings, or such are
allowed on all areas of Michigan?s public land managed by the DNR.

?

Accessible
features on State Wildlife/Game Area include those which have low-slope, no
stairs or steps along features, and are accessible for wheelchairs, or personal
assistive mobility devices (PAMDs).? All
buildings, DNR Shooting-Ranges, and other permanent public use structures are
fully ADA compliant and accessible.? It
is the more natural features being identified in this layer.? Many of these features are fully ADA code
compliant (which is ~1 inch rise or less over 12 inch distances) and are
regularly checked for obstructions, while other features comply with the
low-slope requirements or are identified as such so they are not over-represented
to a lower or no slope level.? In natural
rustic areas it can be difficult to maintain these slope limits and to clearing
check for naturally-occurring obstructions like leaves, sticks or other
naturally occurring items which blow or wash onto trails or outside features.? Therefore, features are frequently identified
as no-slope or low-slope/PAMD levels and not over-represented as fully ADA
compliant.? 

?

The
DNR Wildlife Division is in a updated state-wide review to identify features
and provide better information on accessible features, such as by GIS
compatible layers provided here.? Accessible
features typically include accessible combinations of parking, a trail and a
destination location like a platform or blind location; read the attribute
fields like the ?comment? field, for details on what is at the provided data
point, line or polygon.? Although
available for use by anyone, it's hoped consideration for use will be given to
those individuals that have limited mobility, please, for use of these accessible
parking, trails, blinds or platforms, and other features.? Patience is appreciated for local site
conditions which might be caused by weather, wind or rain, wildlife or other
public users; please report any problems with features to either the local DNR
Wildlife office or the main DNR Wildlife help options (e-mail DNR-Wildlife@michigan.gov , or call 517-284-9453).",2016-10-27T15:23:30.000Z,2017-11-08T20:13:39.000Z,http://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/cc49db9fd8a4469f981dc8df39ba3d75_8,https://gisago.mcgi.state.mi.us/arcgis/rest/services/DNR/dnrWildlife/MapServer/8,"-90.5436,41.6457,-82.0792,48.1903",http://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/cc49db9fd8a4469f981dc8df39ba3d75_8

This layer is one of five that depicts trout and salmon fishing regulations for inland streams for the State of Michigan for April 1, 2016 - April 1, 2018 based on Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Fisheries Order 200.16A.Features from the 1:24,000 scale National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) were used to depict the 2016-2018 Michigan trout and salmon inland stream regulations. NHD features were altered to fit the extent of the regulations described in FO 200.16 and FO 210.16. Every inland stream reach in this package has a regulation type (or multiple regulation types) and a designation status. The regulation type is indicated in the Reg_Type field and the designation status is indicated in the Designated field (with 0 as non-designated and 1 as designated) Each regulation type is associated with specific rules for the length of the fishing and possession seasons, minimum size limits, and daily possession limits. See FO 200.16 and the Michigan Fishing Guide for more details about the individual regulation types.Regulation types are as follows:1 - Type 1 Trout Stream2 - Type 2 Trout Stream3 - Type 3 Trout Stream4 - Type 4 Trout StreamBTRA ? Brook Trout Restoration AreaRA - Research Area Trout StreamGR - Gear Restricted StreamDesignation status is either designated or non-designated. Designated trout streams are inland streams containing a significant population of trout or salmon, as identified by the State of Michigan. Designated trout streams are protected from certain activities, see the Michigan Fishing Guide or FO 210.16 for more details. All Type 1, Type 2, GR, and BTRA are designated trout streams. Most Type 3 and Type 4 streams are designated trout streams. Most inland salmon and trout stream regulations are depicted in the main trout and salmon stream regulations layer. Streams with multiple regulations will have additional features in the BTRA lines, BTRA polygon or the dual regulation layers.  All four layers must be displayed in the proper order using the established symbology to show the trout and salmon inland stream regulations for the state. The BTRA polygon layer should be displayed on the top of the other layers, with the dual regulations underneath the BTRA polygon, the main file underneath the dual regulations, and finally the BTRA lines on the bottom.

These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery.

The baseflow of a stream or river is the amount of groundwater discharged from an aquifer to the watercourse. This discharge occurs year-round, and fluctuates seasonally depending on the level of the water in the aquifer. Baseflow is supplemented by direct runoff during and immediately after precipitation or melt events, resulting in peaks on a hydrograph showing stream flow through time. The process of dividing these peaks into base flow and runoff is called hydrograph separation. Hydrograph separations were completed for all USGS stream- flow gaging stations in Michigan that had more than 10 years of daily records. Sites that were clearly affected by upstream impoundments (lakes, dams) were excluded. No attempt was made to detect or correct for trends in the data. This may lead to some errors in the comparison of streams with data from different time periods if there is an underlying temporal trend in the data, but inclusion of all records in the analysis was necessary to increase the data pool and provide better spatial coverage. Watersheds were delineated for each of the 208 stream-flow gaging stations, and various characteristics of each watershed, such as topographic relief, surficial geology, land cover, growing degree days, annual and winter-season precipitation, and others were tabulated. Regression modeling, described in the Technical Report, was used to estimate the baseflow for each steam segment of the 1:100,000-scale National Hydrography Dataset.",2017-04-27T12:21:24.000Z,2017-11-08T18:10:21.000Z,http://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/1c9b201348d14654a3e011c7db3076de_3,https://gisago.mcgi.state.mi.us/arcgis/rest/services/OpenData/hydro/MapServer/3,"-90.3951,41.2769,-82.4174,47.4692",http://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/1c9b201348d14654a3e011c7db3076de_3

These boundaries, which usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity boundary, have no legal status, nor do these places have officials elected to serve traditional municipal functions. CDP boundaries may change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary.

Lake features from the NHD were altered to fit the extent of the regulations described in FO 200.16. Every lake in this layer has a regulation type and a designation status. Regulation type is indicated in the Reg_Type field and the designation status is indicated in the Designated field (with 0 as non-designated and 1 as designated) Each regulation type is associated with specific rules for the length of the fishing and possession seasons, minimum size limits, daily possession limits, and tackle type. See FO 200.16 and the Michigan Fishing Guide for more details about the individual regulation types.Regulation types are as follows:A ? Type A Trout LakeB - Type B Trout LakeC - Type C Trout LakeD - Type D Trout LakeE ? Type E Trout LakeF ? Type F Trout LakeDesignation status is either designated or non-designated. Designated trout lakes are inland lakes containing a significant population of trout or salmon, as identified by the State of Michigan. Designated trout streams are protected from certain activities, see the Michigan Fishing Guide or FO 200.16 for more details. All Type A and Type D lakes are designated trout lakes. All other trout lakes (Type B, C, E, and F) are non-designated lakes.

The files are constructed to be easily merged, containing the same number and type of attribute fields.Although the derived data in these files represents the best readily available data, the six files do not represent a complete database of all wells or well records in existence. ?Until January 1, 2000 not all water well records for new wells in Michigan were entered into Wellogic.? For wells drilled before 2000 the rate of inclusion is highly variable from one county to another.? Further, there is a quality control check on location that may exclude a limited number of wells from Wellogic from the six files made available on this site.More Metadata",2018-07-12T15:30:59.000Z,2018-07-12T15:34:34.584Z,http://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/daf1e15c23604b258e6400281e2a3b7b_9,https://gisago-qa.mcgi.state.mi.us/arcgis/rest/services/OpenData/public_health/MapServer/9,"-90.4077,41.656,-82.4156,48.1419",http://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/daf1e15c23604b258e6400281e2a3b7b_9

http://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/e8e263ecfc634c56ac89adefd4a21454_3,Base Flow of Michigan Streams,"This data set provides estimates of the ground-water contribution to stream flow, frequently referred to as base flow, in cubic feet per second. The baseflow of a stream or river is the amount of groundwater discharged from an aquifer to the watercourse. This discharge occurs year-round, and fluctuates seasonally depending on the level of the water in the aquifer. Baseflow is supplemented by direct runoff during and immediately after precipitation or melt events, resulting in peaks on a hydrograph showing stream flow through time. The process of dividing these peaks into base flow and runoff is called hydrograph separation. Hydrograph separations were completed for all USGS stream- flow gaging stations in Michigan that had more than 10 years of daily records. Sites that were clearly affected by upstream impoundments (lakes, dams) were excluded. No attempt was made to detect or correct for trends in the data. This may lead to some errors in the comparison of streams with data from different time periods if there is an underlying temporal trend in the data, but inclusion of all records in the analysis was necessary to increase the data pool and provide better spatial coverage. Watersheds were delineated for each of the 208 stream-flow gaging stations, and various characteristics of each watershed, such as topographic relief, surficial geology, land cover, growing degree days, annual and winter-season precipitation, and others were tabulated. Regression modeling, described in the Technical Report, was used to estimate the baseflow for each steam segment of the 1:100,000-scale National Hydrography Dataset.More Metadata",2015-02-27T21:10:28.000Z,2015-06-11T18:00:32.000Z,http://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/e8e263ecfc634c56ac89adefd4a21454_3,https://gisago.mcgi.state.mi.us/arcgis/rest/services/OpenData/hydro/MapServer/3,"-90.3951,41.2769,-82.4174,47.4692",http://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/e8e263ecfc634c56ac89adefd4a21454_3
