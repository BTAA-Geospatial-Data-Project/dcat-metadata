These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979). Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands. These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery. By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of farmed wetlands as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition.

The
Michigan Carpool Parking Lot Program (sometimes referred to as Park and Ride)
began as a pilot program in 1974 with 11 carpool parking lots. Today there are
over 240 carpool parking lots located across the state providing nearly 9,000
parking spaces. In addition to lots owned and maintained by MDOT, the Meijer
Corporation has partnered with MDOT to provide carpool parking at several of
their stores. Please see the?MDOT Metadata Form?for additional information.

Update
Cycle:?Carpool
lots are added and updated as needed when new lots are constructed or removed.

Coverage: This inventory shows all
MDOT owned and operated carpool lots in Michigan along with several Meijer

The baseflow of a stream or river is the amount of groundwater discharged from an aquifer to the watercourse. This discharge occurs year-round, and fluctuates seasonally depending on the level of the water in the aquifer. Baseflow is supplemented by direct runoff during and immediately after precipitation or melt events, resulting in peaks on a hydrograph showing stream flow through time. The process of dividing these peaks into base flow and runoff is called hydrograph separation. Hydrograph separations were completed for all USGS stream- flow gaging stations in Michigan that had more than 10 years of daily records. Sites that were clearly affected by upstream impoundments (lakes, dams) were excluded. No attempt was made to detect or correct for trends in the data. This may lead to some errors in the comparison of streams with data from different time periods if there is an underlying temporal trend in the data, but inclusion of all records in the analysis was necessary to increase the data pool and provide better spatial coverage. Watersheds were delineated for each of the 208 stream-flow gaging stations, and various characteristics of each watershed, such as topographic relief, surficial geology, land cover, growing degree days, annual and winter-season precipitation, and others were tabulated. Regression modeling, described in the Technical Report, was used to estimate the baseflow for each steam segment of the 1:100,000-scale National Hydrography Dataset.More Metadata",2015-02-27T21:10:28.000Z,2017-06-05T16:26:16.348Z,http://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/e8e263ecfc634c56ac89adefd4a21454_3,https://gisago.mcgi.state.mi.us/arcgis/rest/services/OpenData/hydro/MapServer/3,"-90.3951,41.2769,-82.4174,47.4692",http://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/e8e263ecfc634c56ac89adefd4a21454_3

Michigan Department of Environmental Quality statewide ground water database. ?The six files combined contain information on over
575,000 spatially verified water well records.?
The six files are intended to provide water well information for wells
in counties clustered by geographic region: Upper Peninsula, Northern Lower
Peninsula, East Central Lower Peninsula, West Central Lower Peninsula,
Southwest Lower Peninsula and the South Central ? Southeastern Lower Peninsula.? The files are constructed to be easily
merged, containing the same number and type of attribute fields.

Although the derived data in these files represents the
best readily available data, the six files do not represent a complete database
of all wells or well records in existence. ?Until January 1, 2000 not all water well
records for new wells in Michigan were entered into Wellogic.? For wells drilled before 2000 the rate of
inclusion is highly variable from one county to another.? Further, there is a quality control check on
location that may exclude a limited number of wells from Wellogic from the six
files made available on this site.More Metadata",2015-10-16T19:11:22.000Z,2017-06-05T16:23:36.712Z,http://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/7711ba3d99ee4bf1b967812da2e0e21b_6,https://gisago.mcgi.state.mi.us/arcgis/rest/services/OpenData/public_health/MapServer/6,"-90.4077,41.656,-82.4156,48.1419",http://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/7711ba3d99ee4bf1b967812da2e0e21b_6
