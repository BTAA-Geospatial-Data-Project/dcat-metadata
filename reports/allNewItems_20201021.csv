,MDOT SHA Roadway Functional Classification,"Esri ArcGIS Online (AGOL) Hosted Feature Layer which provides access to the MDOT SHA Roadway Functional Classification geospatial data product.MDOT SHA Roadway Functional Classification data consists of linear geometric features which showcase the functional classification of roadways throughout the State of Maryland. Roadway Functional Classification is defined as the role each roadway plays in moving vehicles throughout a network of highways. MDOT SHA Roadway Functional Classification data is primarily used for general planning purposes, and for Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) annual submission & coordination. The Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) currently reports this data only on the inventory direction (generally North or East) side of the roadway. MDOT SHA Roadway Functional Classification data is not a complete representation of all roadway geometry.The State of Maryland's roadway system is a vast network that connects places and people within and across county borders. Planners and engineers have developed elements of this network with particular travel objectives in mind. These objectives range from serving long-distance passenger and freight needs to serving neighborhood travel from residential developments to nearby shopping centers. The functional classification of roadways defines the role each element of the roadway network plays in serving these travel needs.  Over the years, functional classification has come to assume additional significance beyond its purpose as a framework for identifying the particular role of a roadway in moving vehicles through a network of highways. Functional classification carries with it expectations about roadway design, including its speed, capacity and relationship to existing and future land use development. Federal legislation continues to use functional classification in determining eligibility for funding under the Federal-aid program. Transportation agencies describe roadway system performance, benchmarks and targets by functional classification. As agencies continue to move towards a more performance-based management approach, functional classification will be an increasingly important consideration in setting expectations and measuring outcomes for preservation, mobility and safety.MDOT SHA Roadway Functional Classification data is developed as part of the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) which maintains and reports transportation related information to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on an annual basis. HPMS is maintained by the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), under the Office of Planning & Preliminary Engineering (OPPE) Data Services Division (DSD). This data is used by various business units throughout MDOT, as well as many other Federal, State and local government agencies.

,Vegetation of Michigan circa 1800,"Between 1816 and 1856, Michigan was systematically surveyed by the General Land Office (GLO), which had been established by the federal government in 1785. The detailed notes taken by the land surveyors have proven to be a useful source of information on Michigan's landscape as it appeared prior to wide-spread European settlement. Surveyors took detailed notes on the location, species, and diameter of each tree used to mark section lines and section corners. They commented on the locations of rivers, lakes, wetlands, the agricultural potential of soils and the general quality of timber along each section line as they were measured out. Biologists from the Michigan Natural Features Inventory developed a methodology to translate the notes of the GLO surveys into a digital map that can be used by researchers, land managers, and the general public.Click here to see the original report.",English,University of Michigan,University of Michigan,Geospatial data,,Michigan|Vegetation|Circa1800|Landcover|MichiganNaturalFeaturesInventory|GLO|GeneralLandOffice,2020-09-24T16:23:27.000Z,,,,"Ann Arbor, Michigan|Michigan","-90.0517,41.5188,-82.0617,48.3038",Dataset|Service,Vector,Shapefile,https://mbgna-umich.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/1073bcc5e2044a82a5ed1f1a92e1feef_0,https://mbgna-umich.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/1073bcc5e2044a82a5ed1f1a92e1feef_0.zip,,https://services1.arcgis.com/4ezfu5dIwH83BUNL/arcgis/rest/services/Michigan_Land_Cover_Circa_1800/FeatureServer/0,,1073bcc5e2044a82a5ed1f1a92e1feef_0,Michigan,07d-02,07d-02,Active,ArcGIS Hub,,Public,,FALSE,FALSE
