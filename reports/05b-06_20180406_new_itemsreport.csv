This data shows the location of intersection screen lines used to count bicycle and pedestrian traffic. There are two screen lines at each intersection.  In order to capture pedestrian and bicycle traffic in both directions, volunteers count the number of pedestrians and bicyclists that cross each screen line. Screen lines are linked to intersections by a count location ID

Each year, Hennepin County collects 48 hour bicycle counts for sites across either the northern (cycle B) or southern half (cycle A) of the county using MetroCount RoadPod tube counters. This dataset contains the boundaries of the two count zones.

Each year, Hennepin County collects 48 hour bicycle counts for sites across either the northern (cycle B) or southern half (cycle A) of the county using MetroCount RoadPod tube counters. Additional locations, such as CIP counts may be added to a cycle. 48 hour counts are converted to AADB using data from six permanent bicycle counters across the county.

Locations classified as bikeway gaps are short (1/2 mile or less) connections that are needed to ensure continuity in the bikeway system. This data corresponds with Appendix E of the Hennepin County 2040 bike plan, and shows the gap ID, initial gap score, and general planned facility type.

Since 2016, Hennepin County has organized counts at locations outside of Minneapolis, counting both pedestrians and bicyclists. These short term counts rely on volunteers collecting data over a two-hour window, from 4:00-6:00 PM during the second week of September each year. The raw data from the counts was then used to calculate estimated daily traffic (EDT) at each site, which means that 2-hour counts are extrapolated to understand larger trends in walking and biking. Hennepin County?s volunteer counts take place in conjunction with the City of Minneapolis pedestrian and bicycle counts. Hennepin County leads the initiative for all counts outside of the City of Minneapolis; however, the county still utilizes data for county roads within the City of Minneapolis. This data shows the EDT for pedestrians and bicyclists at each intersection, in all directions.
