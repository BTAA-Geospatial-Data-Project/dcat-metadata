Within the LRP, two divisions exist to oversee assessment and remediation of potentially contaminated sites.  The State Assessment and Remediation Division includes the Voluntary Cleanup Program (VCP) and CHS Enforcement Sections.  The Federal Assessment and Remediation Division includes the Federal IRP Support Section and NPL/Site Assessment section.  
This dataset describes any VCP applicant or responsible party for the LRP oversight for each site relative to these programs.

information at?http://imap.maryland.gov.The storm surge zones data used in this application were generated using the Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model. SLOSH is a computerized model run by the National Weather Service to estimate storm surge heights resulting from historical, hypothetical, or predicted hurricanes. The model creates its estimates by assessing the pressure, size, forward speed, track, and wind data from a storm. Graphical output from the model displays color-coded storm surge heights for a particular area. The calculations are applied to a specific locale's shoreline, incorporating the unique bay and river configurations, water depths, bridges, roads, and other physical features. This file is generated as part of the Hazards Analysis within the Hurricane Evacuation Study for the Maryland Western Shore.Last Updated: 11/2016
