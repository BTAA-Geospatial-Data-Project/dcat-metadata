It was flown in early March, completed on March 8, 2017.Further details included in download XML file.Due to technical difficulties, the downtown area is not comprised of true orthoimagery. The contractor worked to minimize building lean by using the increased side-lap of imagery.The aerial imagery acquisition was flown to support the creation of 4-band digital orthophotography with a 3 inch/0.08 meter pixel resolution over the full project area covering the District of Columbia which is approximately 69 square miles. The contractor received waivers to fly in the Flight Restricted Zone (FRZ) and P-56 areas. The ortho imagery was submitted to the District's Chief Technology Office (OCTO) in GeoTiff/TFW format tiles following the tile scheme provided by OCTO. MrSID and JPEG2000 compressed mosaics were delivered as well using a 50:1 compression ratio.All District geospatial data is stored and exported in Maryland State Plane coordinates NAD 83 meters.",2017-11-30T16:23:50.000Z,2017-12-20T21:30:15.775Z,http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/b2685c77342540078abd9d9720a039d7,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FO9wejPeA6G93EYEitU_niEGfouGMevy,"-77.136,38.786,-76.928,38.994",http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/b2685c77342540078abd9d9720a039d7
