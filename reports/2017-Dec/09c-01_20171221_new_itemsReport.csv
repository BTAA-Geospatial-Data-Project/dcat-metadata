MrSID file was derived from the 2015 raster dataset, which consists of 8-bit,
4-band (R, G, B, NIR) color orthoimagery. A digital orthoimage is a raster
image processed from vertical aerial images in which displacement in the image
due to sensor orientation and terrain relief have been removed. Orthoimagery
combines the image characteristics of an image with the geometric qualities of
a map. Unlike planimetric maps which depict natural and manmade features by
means of lines, point symbols, texts and polygons, orthoimagery illustrates the
actual images of features and are thus more easily interpreted than regular
maps. The normal orientation of data in an orthoimage is by lines (rows) and
samples (columns). Each line contains a series of pixels ordered from west to
east with the order of the lines from north to south. Each image tile is stored
in industry standard TIFF (tagged interchange file format) with an associated
TIFF world file. Aerial imagery was acquired between April 12 and 15 2015 from
flying heights of approximately 1400-1640 feet above ground level (AGL). Each
orthoimage tile is 2500feet X 2500feet in dimension, edge-tied with the
adjacent tiles (no gap and no overlap). This dataset is published in

MrSID file was derived from the 2015 raster dataset, which consists of 8-bit,
4-band (R, G, B, NIR) color orthoimagery. A digital orthoimage is a raster
image processed from vertical aerial images in which displacement in the image
due to sensor orientation and terrain relief have been removed. Orthoimagery
combines the image characteristics of an image with the geometric qualities of
a map. Unlike planimetric maps which depict natural and manmade features by
means of lines, point symbols, texts and polygons, orthoimagery illustrates the
actual images of features and are thus more easily interpreted than regular
maps. The normal orientation of data in an orthoimage is by lines (rows) and
samples (columns). Each line contains a series of pixels ordered from west to
east with the order of the lines from north to south. Each image tile is stored
in industry standard TIFF (tagged interchange file format) with an associated
TIFF world file. Aerial imagery was acquired between April 12 and 15 2015 from
flying heights of approximately 1400-1640 feet above ground level (AGL). Each
orthoimage tile is 2500feet X 2500feet in dimension, edge-tied with the

MrSID file was derived from the 2015 raster dataset, which consists of 8-bit,
4-band (R, G, B, NIR) color orthoimagery. A digital orthoimage is a raster
image processed from vertical aerial images in which displacement in the image
due to sensor orientation and terrain relief have been removed. Orthoimagery
combines the image characteristics of an image with the geometric qualities of
a map. Unlike planimetric maps which depict natural and manmade features by
means of lines, point symbols, texts and polygons, orthoimagery illustrates the
actual images of features and are thus more easily interpreted than regular
maps. The normal orientation of data in an orthoimage is by lines (rows) and
samples (columns). Each line contains a series of pixels ordered from west to
east with the order of the lines from north to south. Each image tile is stored
in industry standard TIFF (tagged interchange file format) with an associated
TIFF world file. Aerial imagery was acquired between April 12 and 15 2015 from
flying heights of approximately 1400-1640 feet above ground level (AGL). Each
orthoimage tile is 2500feet X 2500feet in dimension, edge-tied with the
adjacent tiles (no gap and no overlap). This dataset is published in
